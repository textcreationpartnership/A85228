            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow the ſeveral points handled in this Treatiſe, concern this Reformed Church, will be declared below, when firſt we have taken notice of the cauſeleſs Aſperſions and Reproaches, which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ceaſe not to caſt upon is, and against which theſe Conſiderations are purpoſely intended and oppoſed. They think, they have now a fitter oportunity, by reaſon of the confuſions of theſe Times, to deal that way by Reproaches, then as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Arguments. And it is no new thing for the enemies of Gods Truth, to ſcoff at the afflicted condition of the profeſſors
<pb facs="tcp:114611:3"/>of it. The <hi>Ammonite</hi> is challenged for it, <hi>Ezek. 25.3. Thou ſaidſt, Aha, againſt my Sanctuary, when it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned;</hi> and ſo is <hi>Tyrus, Ezek. 26.2. Thou ſaidſt againſt Jeruſalem, Aha, ſhe is broken, and laid waſt, I ſhall be repleniſhed;</hi> and ſo the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> looking now upon our diſturbances ſay with thoſe in the Pſal. <hi>35.21. Aha, we have ſeen it with our eyes,</hi> and <hi>ſo would we have it:</hi> Endeavouring by mocks and ſcoffs againſt the Engliſh Church, to prevaile with ungrounded Proteſtants, and all unwary ones that will be jeered out of their Religion.</p>
            <p>One of their Pamphlets ſet out by a late <hi>Romiſh</hi> Convert, the Reader muſt give me leave by the way to inſtance in: for it gives us proof and example, of what I ſaid both wayes; It ſhewes us a giddy unwary Proteſtant fooliſhly carryed away by the reproachful allegations of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; and, having been a while among them, preſently inſtructed in this their way of ſcoffing at that Church and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had forſaken.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:114611:3"/>
            <p>Some of his wit he ſpends in a <hi>few Curſory animadverſions,</hi> as he calls them, upon my former Treatiſe; Thoſe I let paſs as inconſiderable, and not fit to trouble the Reader with. But the deſigne of his book was againſt that Learned and Solid piece of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſet out by Act of Convocation, <hi>1647.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt admitting of the Covenant. He tells us there, He is <hi>W. R.</hi> ſometimes of <hi>Exeter</hi> Colledge, but now a Convert of <hi>Rome,</hi> and is not aſhamed to profeſs (that we may know his weaknes) he had <hi>his impulſive cauſe of conjunction with Rome,</hi> from that Act of the Univerſity, pleading Tradition, and the neceſsity of it, as for Epiſcopacy, ſo for other chief points of Faith. But (alas!) poor man, he did not underſtand either what thoſe Learned men ſaid, or what our Church allowes in the point of Tradition. For however he pretend to <hi>Wit</hi> in reproving our Reformation and Religion, yet in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, when be ventures on it, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves himſelf as a manforſaken of his <hi>Reaſon.</hi> By his Titles prefixed to his
<pb facs="tcp:114611:4"/>book, one may read what strein he meant to follow, &amp; hold throughout his whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: for being not content to have at firſt entitled it, <hi>An Examination of the Oxford Act;</hi> he gives it two ſcoffing Titles more, <hi>The Obit of Praelatick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancie;</hi> and again, <hi>The laſt dying words of Epiſcopacy, faintly delivered in the Convocation at Oxford</hi>—So he of the Modeſt and Sober Defence of thoſe Learned Men, againſt the then prevailing force. And ſo might any Heathen <hi>(Julian,</hi> or <hi>Prophyry)</hi> have derived the Apologies of the Ancients in the behalf of Chriſtianity then under per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and might have called them, <hi>The laſt dying Words</hi> of Chriſtian Religion; So might the <hi>Arrians</hi> have termed the Defenſes which <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and others made, <hi>The laſt dying Words</hi> of the Catholick cauſe; and becauſe Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> expreſseth it dolefully, with a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus &amp; ingemuit Orbis—the whole Chriſtian world wondred and ſighed to ſee her ſelfe made Arrian,</hi> Such a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner as this might conclude, the true
<pb facs="tcp:114611:4"/>Chriſtian Faith was then groaning her laſt. Now albeit, there is nothing in this Pamphlet conſiderable, either againſt our Church, or againſt Epiſcopacy reteined in it; yet did it give me occaſion of further thoughts concerning them both; and in order to the lawful Calling and Ordination of our Proteſtant Biſhops, to examine what <hi>Champny</hi> (who profeſsedly wrote againſt them) hath alleged.</p>
            <p>In the next place that I may give the Reader a better account of what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the former, and now purſued in this following Treatiſe, He may pleaſe to take notice how the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> charge us with Schiſm in departing from their Communion upon our Reformation, and reproach us with the Confuſions of theſe Times, as wrought under the like pretence of Reformation, and defenſible by the like principles, upon which we ſtood in the work of our Reforming, and to which we muſt hold in the defenſe of it. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the falſhood of both: Either that We, who are now of a divided Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion from <hi>Rome,</hi> are therefore guilty
<pb facs="tcp:114611:5"/>of Schiſm; or that They, who made the rupture in the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> first, and then in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, can ſay juſtly for themſelves against the former Doctrine and Government of thoſe Churches, what we can for our ſelves, against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it was part of the work and purpoſe of the former book.</p>
            <p>And it was demonſtrable upon theſe grounds: <hi>1.</hi> There was a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and we had juſt <hi>Cauſe</hi> for it, by reaſon of the over-grown Papall power and the intolerable abuſes in Doctrine and Worſhip: <hi>2.</hi> It was Warrantably done, not only for the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of it, but alſo for the <hi>Autority</hi> by which it was done, whether we conſider the Vote of the Clergy, and the Iudgment of a Nationall Synod, or the aſſent and command of the ſupreme and Sovereign power.</p>
            <p>In which regard we ſee the Vanity of all that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> allege from the Ancients concluding Schiſm Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively or Negatively by Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for however that Argument might be good when that
<pb facs="tcp:114611:5"/>Church ſtood right, and held the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith undefiled,</hi> yet was it no more then they might and did conclude by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with other famous Churches, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly Catholick. No ſuch concluſion can now be made upon holding or not holding Communion with the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, ſince it gave ſuch Cauſe of Reformation, as aboveſaid.</p>
            <p>We ſee alſo the Vanity of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches: that we leave every man to his privat Iudgment and Reaſon: that we open a gap to all Sectaries, to work confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when they get force, in any Church. For however we leave men the uſe of their Reaſon and Iudgment in order to their own believing, yet in order to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation we require not only <hi>juſt cauſe</hi> in regard of intolerable Error or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, but alſo <hi>due Autority</hi> for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it on in the way of the Church. Theſe particulars were ſpoken to more or leſs in the firſt part of the former book. Now for the further clearing of this point of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reformation, and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſo againſt the reproaches of Papiſts,
<pb facs="tcp:114611:6"/>that no Sectaries may pretend to the like defenſe, I thought it not amiſs to treat upon theſe three points chiefly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Submiſsion of Iudgment, and the external peaceable ſubjection due to a Church. For unleſs that be yeelded in due meaſure, there will be no preſerving of peace and Unity, no keeping out of Error: and unleſs that be required in due meaſure (not abſolutely and Tyrannically exacted) there will be no Reformation of Errors, when they have prevailed. The firſt we contend for, and I have endeavoured to ſet the bounds of it as near as I can in the firſt Chapter. The other (<hi>viz.</hi> abſolute ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion) the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo far chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges, that ſhe makes her ſelf thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible. And hence it is we finde her ſo liberal of <hi>Anathema</hi>'s, in all her <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions,</hi> however inconſiderable or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from Truth the matter of them be.</p>
            <p>The firſt General Councels had to do with Hereſies touching the Foundation, and might well pronounce <hi>Anathema</hi> to them that believed or taught otherwiſe
<pb facs="tcp:114611:6"/>then they defined in thoſe Fundamentals; but it had been well, if after-Councels had been more ſparing in their <hi>Definitions,</hi> and more mercifull in their <hi>Anathema's.</hi> For although they conceived this to be the way to binde up all profeſſors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in a streiter bond of Peace and Unity, yet it ſeems to have wrought to the contrary upon a double reaſon: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was notorious, that after-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels did ſometimes out of faction or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance define againſt the Truth, and were notwithſtanding as peremptory in their Decrees and <hi>Anathema</hi>'s: alſo becauſe it is to be deſired rather then expected, that Christians ſhould be all of one mind, and a due liberty of d ſsenting in points, wherein <hi>(ſalvâ pietate &amp; charitate)</hi> good men may differ, makes for preſerving of Peace and Unity, rather then a peremptory binding them under <hi>Anathema,</hi> to think and ſpeak the ſame thing. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath thought this good wiſdome in ſome few points, as <hi>the Conception of the bleſſed Virgin, the Popes power in Temporals,</hi> &amp;c. in which ſhe allower
<pb facs="tcp:114611:7"/>diſsent of judgments and belief, being content to hold ſuch an external Peace and Unity as is poſsible.</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid, that the <hi>Anathema's</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in her <hi>Trent</hi> Councel; are pronounced upon the <hi>dixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> againſt him, that ſhall <hi>ſay</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: and we acknowlege that he who ſhall pertinaciouſly, turbulently ſpeak and teach againſt the Doctrine of the Church in points of leſs moment, may deſerve to be Anathematized or put out of the Church; for ſuch a one, though he deny not the faith, yet makes a breach of charity, whereby he goes out of the Church, againſt which he ſo ſets himſelf; but to faſten the <hi>Anathema</hi> to a bare <hi>dixerit,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, which will not ſuffer her Definitions to be ſpoken againſt how modeſtly ſoever, is too preſumptuous: yea ſomtimes to fix it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>ſenſerit,</hi> the thinking or believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe, as the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> hath done, though very rarely, is yet more preſumptuous and Tyrannical: In the last Canon, <hi>de peccato Origin:</hi> having
<pb facs="tcp:114611:7"/>defined <hi>Concupiſcence in the Regenerato not to have the Nature of Sin,</hi> it adds, <hi>Si quis contrà ſenſerit, Anathema ſit.</hi> If any think or believe the contrary, let him be accurſed. And this is agreeable to that abſolute ſubmiſsion of belief, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> requires to her Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: where he is accounted no Cotholick that doth not entirely hold, what ſhe hath decreed to be held and beleived; as there will be occaſion to ſhew in the firſt Chapter of <hi>due Submiſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The next General point, will be the warrantableneſs of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, begun at firſt by a National Synod under <hi>Henr.</hi> the Eight: carryed on ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiably under <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth: and perfected under Qu: <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Synod, <hi>62.</hi> Where the whole body of Uniform Doctrine was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, drawn up and publiſhed in <hi>39.</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. The power alſo of Regal Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy will be conſiderable, as to this work of Reformation, for the cauſing, carrying on, and eſtabliſhing thereof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is one thing more, which
<pb facs="tcp:114611:8"/>mainly concerns a Church: The Lawful Ordination of Paſtors by Biſhops accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the perpetual way of the Church; in which reſpect our Reformation was more regular then in thoſe Churches that are without Biſhops. This defenſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers to theſe times do not pretend to: nay, have called themſelves off from it by caſting out Biſhops, when they had them in the Churches of all the three Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtolical institution of Biſhops hath been ſufficiently cleared by many, in ſpecial by Doctor <hi>Hammond;</hi> in his learned Diſſertations against <hi>Blondel,</hi> and the Presbyterian claim. Our work here is againſt the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> who, admitting ſuch Inſtitution of them, deny plainly that we have ſuch Biſhops, ſo ordained: for, being not able here to reproach us, as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they do, by ſaying <hi>Sectaries may plead the like for their pretended Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> they ſeek by all means they can, to undermine this Church by overthrowing the Ordination of our Biſhops, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the lawful calling of our Paſtors.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:114611:8"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Sanders, Stapleton, Kelliſon, Harding, Fitz-Simons</hi> and others laboured much in this work, before Master <hi>Maſon</hi> ſet out his book in defenſe of our Proteſtant Biſhops, and their Ordination. Since that, <hi>Ant: Champny,</hi> Engliſhman, and Doctor of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> undertook the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, againſt all Reformed Churches in a book of <hi>19.</hi> Chapters; The firſt eight he ſpends againſt the Calling of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in theſe Reformed Churches which have not Biſhops, the reſt againſt the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or Ordination of our Biſhops: taking in <hi>Maſon</hi> all along, and with great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence triumphing over him at every turne. Certainly, he hath ſaid as much in the Argument as can be ſaid, how firmely, we ſhall ſee upon examination. And although it hath carryed me beyond my intended meaſure, yet I determined to follow him by treſpaſsing upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Patience, who, I hope, will conſider the concernment of this point (the having of lawfull Biſhops) in oppoſition both to the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> uſually reproaching us, you have no <hi>Prieſts,</hi> no <hi>Biſhops,</hi> no
<pb facs="tcp:114611:9"/>
               <hi>Church:</hi> and alſo to the Presbyterians inconſideratly rejecting them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly undertaking to Ordain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. He that holds it not a point of concernment, let him tel me, how he likes the confuſed Eſtate of this Church, ſince the violence done unto Biſhops; or how he can ſatisfie the Papiſts objecting the want of due calling, where Biſhops are not: Nay, how he can anſwer the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church, which never knew any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Government then by Biſhops, as chief Paſtors in every Church.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoken the intent of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, I must, before I leave him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Reader to remember one thing in the former, (the Error of the <hi>Millenary</hi> belief, and <hi>Infant-Communion</hi> often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced there) and to take notice, that nothing was intended or can be concluded by thoſe Instances to the prejudice of the whole Church, as if thereby might be proved, that the whole Church Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally and in all the Members of it may Err, and be infected with Error in points of concernment, or prejudicial to
<pb facs="tcp:114611:9"/>the Faith; for that of the <hi>Millenary,</hi> as it was not Univerſal, ſo not of ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and that of the <hi>Infant-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> though more Univerſal and of longer continuance, was but a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Mistake. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> indeed, in her Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> hath pronounced <hi>Anathema</hi> to them, that ſhall ſay, <hi>ſuch communicating of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants is Neceſſary:</hi> which the ancient Church of <hi>Rome</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> the firſt did, no queſtion, ſay, and accordingly practiſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore the inſtances of thoſe Errors were not, as I ſaid, directed againſt the whole Church, but onely made uſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Errors there prevailing, which they will not acknowledge can take hold on that Church: Firſt, to ſhew that the uſe of Private judgment (which they ſcoff at) is neceſſary in diſcovering and for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Errors prevailing; theſe two inſtanced in, being ſo diſcovered, and thereupon left off. Secondly, to ſhew that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did Err in this
<pb facs="tcp:114611:10"/>of <hi>Infant Communion;</hi> Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> telling us directly, <hi>L. 1. Cont. Julian. c. 1. Definivit Innocentius, Niſi manduca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verint—Innocentius defined, unleſs they</hi> (Infants) <hi>eat the fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> Nay ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Definivit Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus—the Lord himſelf defined it, when he ſaid, Except ye eat and drink the—ye have no life in you.</hi> S. <hi>Joh. 6.35.</hi> Whereby it is plain, that the practiſe of Iufant. Communion being raiſed from that place, <hi>Except ye eat,</hi>—S. <hi>John 6.</hi> was held needful; and ſo it was held and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> however the <hi>Trent</hi> Councel condemning this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, ſlubbers it over, ſaying, it was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed <hi>quibuſdam in locis, in ſome places,</hi> as if not in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: and that the Ancients doing ſo, held no neceſsity of it. Thirdly, to ſhew that no point of Faith or Worſhip, wherein they and we differ, did ſo generally prevail in the Church and with ſo little contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction made to it, as thoſe Errors did, for ſome Ages. It is true, that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in his <hi>Dial. cum Tryiph.</hi> inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates,
<pb facs="tcp:114611:10"/>that many piouſly affected, did not entertain the <hi>Millenary</hi> belief, yet he tells us, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>That all who were in all points Orthodox, or of right Judgment held it:</hi> and I ſaid no more, pag. <hi>58.</hi> of the former book; Alſo, of all that wrote for <hi>300.</hi> yeers even down to <hi>Lactantius</hi> incluſively, moſt of them avouch it, not one of them (as I can finde) contradicting or writing againſt it. Whereas we can ſay to the Errors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that there were alwayes many piouſly affected, who entertained them not, and that they are upon Record, and their contradiction to thoſe prevailing Errors more apparent, then was any made to the <hi>Millenary</hi> for the firſt <hi>300.</hi> yeers, or to <hi>Infant-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> for moe Ages. This is clear by the many Authors yet extant, which (albeit partial for the moſt part in the cauſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet) tell us of the oppoſition made to the prevailing conceit of a tranſubſtantiating of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Euchariſt, from <hi>Bertram</hi> down to <hi>Berengarius;</hi> and after him how
<pb facs="tcp:114611:11"/>many oppoſed that, and other Errors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to the time of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> and fromt hence downward to the laſt Age. All this I ſay, is upon Record in many Writers of former times. Laſtly, to ſhew, by the prevailing of thoſe two Errors (of the <hi>Millennium</hi> and <hi>Infant-Communion)</hi> without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction recorded, how Cardinal <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> two Rules for knowing, who and what was Catholick, according to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, were vaine and inconſiſtent with truth; of which <hi>Sect. 31.</hi> of the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer book. To theſe purpoſes was uſe made of thoſe two prevailing Errors againſt the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

The <hi>Autority</hi> is publick, and (though not Infallible, yet) gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding others by an Infallible rule, and moſt highly concerned to guide them accordingly, as being anſwerable for their ſouls. The condition of the <hi>Matter</hi> alſo was obſerved to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, according to the difference of <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> and in each kind to be of more or leſſe concernment, according to the Nature of the things propounded to us, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or practiſed by us. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall reſult was, that we ought to yeild all the Submiſſion of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and peaceable ſubjection, which ſuch <hi>Autority</hi> may require, and all that the condition of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will admit of. Thus much was inſinuated in the former book.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:114611:14"/>
               <p n="2">2. Now to make a ſupply to that,
<note place="margin">Difficulty in fixing thoſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.</note> which was briefly couched there, and to diſcover more particularly the hounds and limits of this <hi>Submiſſion,</hi> which to fixe preciſely is no eaſie matter. For this <hi>Submiſſion</hi> muſt be carryed even between God and Men, ſuch Men as God himſelf hath ſet over us in his Church, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to hear and obey them: Yet ſuch as poſſibly may entrench upon his right, in taking to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>a dominion over our Faith,</hi> and if we follow them in a blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and reſignation of judgment wholly, we are ſure to tranſgreſſe in giving to them, what is due to God; So alſo muſt this <hi>Submiſſion</hi> be carryed even between Man and Man, by declining the <hi>Romiſh</hi> exceſs of arrogating too much to the <hi>publick Autority,</hi> and avoiding the other extreme of giving too much Liberty to <hi>Private Judgment,</hi> into which Anabaptiſts and other Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries run, and thereby make void the Autority and Office of the Paſtors of the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore that we may better
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114611:15"/>diſcover the bounds of <hi>due Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> we muſt take aim, as aboveſaid, from the conſideration.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Generall conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> of the <hi>Autority</hi> to which the ſubmiſſion is yeilded: That we finde ſeated in the Church Nationall, or Univerſall, and juſtly requiring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the reſpective Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The Church we hear ſpeaking her judgment by the Biſhops and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of it, either in or out of Councel; and whether it do ſpeak either way ſecured from poſſibility of Error, will be conſiderable in the yeelding of our Submiſſion to it. Secondly, of the <hi>Matter</hi> or things, in which this Submiſſion is yeilded: Theſe we finde as was ſaid to be of ſeverall ſorts. Some are onely in <hi>Opinion or belief,</hi> which being inward need not happily diſcover it ſelf: Some are in <hi>Practice,</hi> as Worſhip, Diſcipline, Rites, Ceremonies; which being outward muſt needs appear. Now in reference to both <hi>Autority</hi> and <hi>Matter,</hi> we ſhall have occaſion to conſider the <hi>Extent</hi> of Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from Judgment and belief (which begin within) to external
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114611:15"/>compliance and conformity of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; and accordingly, in the <hi>Manner</hi> of performance, this ſubmiſſion ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtayes our judgment and belief within, when it diſſents, or diſcovers it without, but ſo as not to a diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of peace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Judgment and Reaſon is that Light, which <hi>he that lighteth every one that comes into the World, Joh.</hi> 1.9. puts into the minde of Man, in order to his yeilding aſſent and belief to that which is propounded; This light, as it ſhines inwardly to the aforeſaid purpoſe, may not be put out, by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſubmiſſion, or reſignation of judgment to Man, or any company of Men; but as it is a light to ſhine outward for direction of others, ſo it may be concealed. For though a Man doth not acquieſce inwardly to that which is propounded, yet may he be ſilent in ſome caſes, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to publiſh his judgment to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Theſe things being premiſed, come we to ſome concluſions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſubmiſſion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. From the conſideration of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority,</hi> to which ſubmiſſion is due, we may ſay,</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:114611:16"/>
               <p n="1">I.
<note place="margin">Paſtors of the Church ſingly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken have a publik Authority.</note> Seeing the Church ſpeaks her Judgment by the Paſtors and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in it, every ſuch Paſtor is a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Perſon, and by his Office and Commiſſion for teaching, guiding, &amp; ruling others, hath, in regard of all them, Autority &amp; publick Judgment, to which there is a ſubmiſſion due. <hi>They ſit in Moſes chair</hi>— and <hi>He, that deſpiſeth you, despiſeth me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. <hi>Submit</hi> and <hi>obey,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 13.17. All which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Paſtors and Teachers of the Church, not as joyned in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, but ſeverally taken, and ſo teaching what the Church has learnt of Chriſt, and what it declares and commands agreeable to the voice of the great Paſtor, ſpeaking in the Word. This Concluſion is againſt Anabaptiſts and Sectaries, that make void the Office and Authority of the Paſtors of the Church; and againſt all others, that, acknowledging the Office, do too much weaken the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority, receiving what they teach and declare, with little or no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, then if the ſame were ſpoken to them by any other Men. They of the

                  <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, as they are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind hand in giving Autority to their Prieſts or Paſtors, ſo do they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it not ſecured from error; and the ſubmiſſion due to it not to be abſolute but limited. We need not therefore quarrel with them here. Al the buſineſs wil be, to conclude upon that ſubmiſſion, which is due to the Paſtors of the Church joyned or met in Councel, to give out the Judgment of the Church.</p>

<note place="margin">Paſtors or Biſhops met in Councel.</note> Therefore we cannot but ſay, If they that meet either in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial or National (much more in a General) Councel, be <hi>gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Name of Chriſt,</hi> they have the promiſe of his preſence among them, which is by the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, S. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20.

               <p n="7">7.
<note place="margin">The aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance promiſed to them that meet in Chriſts Name.</note> Now to know the Importance of this place, the promiſe and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be conſidered. The <hi>promiſe</hi> of Chriſts <hi>being in the midſt of them,</hi> is made as we ſee, <hi>to two or three,</hi> even to the meaneſt Eccleſiaſtical meeting or Synod, and therefore cannot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that <hi>infallible guidance,</hi> which among the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> is applied only to General Councels, or to the Pope with his Conſiſtory. What then? It muſt needs imply ſuch aſſiſtance as is needful and ſufficient: Such, as we acknowledg there can be no danger for any in the Church, in ſubmitting to her Definitions, when and where ſuch aſſiſtance is given.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But for that we muſt look to the <hi>Condition</hi> required: <hi>to be gathered together in the name of Chriſt; viz.</hi> With due Autority from him, and with mindes anſwerable to the end and purpoſe of their meeting, that is,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114611:17"/>with mindes free from worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and deſigns, and from all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious engagements, ſeeking unfein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly the glory of God, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the true Catholick faith; and therefore ſetting before them the only Infallible Rule of Faith and Truth, Gods Word, attending to it with due heed and ſubmiſſion, and with prayer (for that is expreſs in the Text, <hi>to ask</hi>) for aſſiſtance. To ſuch, <hi>ſo gathered in the name of Chriſt,</hi> the promiſe wil be made good, and the iſſue wil be a declaration of the Truth in all matters of Belief and Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Now for our Submiſſion;
<note place="margin">The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> were it certain they ſo met together in Chriſts name, as it is certain the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe wil be made good to them, if ſo met together, no more would remain for us to do, but to ſubmit to their Definitions without any fear of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or farther inquiry, whether they be anſwerable to that Infallible Rule. But we muſt needs ſay</p>
               <p n="3">III. It is not certain, that they which meet in Councels are ſo ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together; Sometimes it is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114611:18"/>certain and notorious, that they are not; as, in the ſecond Councel of <hi>Epheſius,</hi> a packed faction prevailed to the advancing of the <hi>Entychian</hi> Hereſy; and in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Councels for theſe later Ages, the Papall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and faction hath managed and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled all: ſo apparently in their glorious Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> that it was often and openly complained of, while the Councel was ſitting, and the decrees of that Councel not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in <hi>France</hi> for about 40. years after it was concluded. Can we ſay ſuch Councels are gathered in the Name of Chriſt? or that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe can belong to ſuch, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit (which the Romaniſts pretend) can be given to ſuch a company of Men, ſo gathered together, ſo overſwayed with factious intereſts? or to a Pope, be he what he wil be for perſon, ſo he be Pope? For ſuch to ſay <hi>Viſum eſt Spiritui ſancto, &amp; nobi—It hath ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us,</hi> what wants it of blaſphemous arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy? and what wants it of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his ſin, to think the Holy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114611:18"/>Ghoſt can be bought with Money? or bound to a Pope that hath bought his Chair and enters <hi>Simoniacally?</hi> or to a company of Men, whoſe Votes in Councel are purchaſed with Gold, or golden hopes of preferment, as it fared with a great part of them that met at <hi>Trent,</hi> being either Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, Popes Penſioners, or bound to him upon like worldly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
               <p n="10">10. But at the beſt, where there is not evident cauſe of exception, yet can there not be certainty, that they which meet in Councel, are ſo ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the Name of Chriſt, with ſuch minds, purpoſes and endeavours, as above required. Now the Iſſue of the promiſe depends upon perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Condition: of which performance though we may have a great preſumption, in regard of their learning and judgment, and their high concernment, as being anſwerable for mens ſouls, (beſides the care and reſpect that God hath towards his Church) yet can we not have ſuch a certainty, as ſimply and abſolutely to ground ſubmiſſion of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114611:19"/>judgment and belief upon it; and therefore we receive their Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning Faith, and Worſhip, not finally or chiefly upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption we have of their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, or conformity to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the promiſe, but upon the evidence of that conformity, which their Definitions have to the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rule. It was the care of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and of the true Apoſtles (and ſo it ſhould be of all the Paſtors of the Church) <hi>by the demonſtration of the Truth, to commend themſelves to every Mans Conſcience,</hi> that they <hi>have not handled the word of God deceitfully,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. Upon this evidence or demonſtration of Truth, the Four firſt general Councels have been ſo generally ſubmitted to, ſo readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by all good Chriſtians.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114611:20"/>them from Gods word, and ſeeing our judgment is not to be compared with theirs, whoſe profeſſion is the ſtudy or interpretation of Gods Word, and whoſe <hi>lips preſerve know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> therefore we muſt have ſuch <hi>Evidence</hi> of that greater <hi>Authority</hi> on our ſide; that is apparent to any that can uſe his reaſon, before we deny our ſubmiſſion to them. But ſome may ſay, if we cannot yeild ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of judgment and belief, yet ought we to ſubmit ſo far as not to publiſh it, not to oppoſe Authority: It is true, ſubmiſſion, as above was inſinuated, extends it ſelf ſo far even to a ſuffering for our judgment and belief, and ſuch ſubmiſſion is due to the Paſtors and Governors of the Church, by vertue of their publick Autority; but the conſideration of ſubmiſſion in the ſeveral extent of it much depends upon the ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>Maiter,</hi> in which we ſubmit unto <hi>Autority,</hi> of which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; here we are upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of judgment due unto <hi>Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> as to the unward belief; which ſubmiſſion we affirm to be not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute

Miniſters, Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Guides they are in the way of Salvation; but as it is one thing for a Man to follow a Guide, til he ſee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent danger, another thing to be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114611:21"/>led by him blindfold: So is it one thing to follow our ſpiritual Guides with a conditional belief, or reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to Gods-Word, yea and to follow them to a miſtruſt of our own judgment, or knowledge we have of the way; another thing to reſign up judgment and belief to them, and put out that light of reaſon which God hath put in us, in order to our receiving direction for the way of Salvation.

               <p n="12">12.
<note place="margin">Several conditions of the matter in which.</note> The matters or things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church declares her judgment, and requires Submiſſion, are of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers condition (as was above inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated;) ſome are matters of <hi>Opinion or belief only;</hi> and theſe, as they are of different condition from matters of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114611:21"/>
                  <hi>Practiſe,</hi> and outward exerciſe, ſo are they to be diſtinguiſhed one from the other in the Declarations of the Church: for it is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in our yeilding of Submiſſion, to know what things are <hi>Credenda</hi> or matters of belief, ſtrictly taken for Catholick Faith, ſuch as the prime Articles, <hi>Chriſt God and Man,</hi> and the like, or their immediat and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conſequences, <hi>Two wills in Chriſt, Natures diſtinct and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded:</hi> and what things again are <hi>Credibilia;</hi> Credible Truths or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Opinion, or belief largely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Alſo it is conſiderable, What the Church hath declared as Articles of Faith, and what ſhe hath ſhewed her judgement in, as Credible Truths, but not impoſing them as Articles of Catholick Faith: for in caſe ſhe ſhould miſtake in theſe, the danger in conforming our judgment to hers is the leſs; as if a Church upon mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake ſhould (as many of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents thought) judg it Credible, <hi>That the ſouls of juſt men are not admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the glorious preſence of God, til the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> or that there may be ſome

So likewiſe Matters of <hi>Practice</hi> are of divers forts, and of greater or leſs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

In matters of Belief or Opinion, our ſubjection to a publick judgment ſtands in a conformity of our judgment and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to the publick, and in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing or not publiſhing of our judgment. In Matters of <hi>practice,</hi> our Submiſſion ſtands in the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of judgment, if we judge of Worſhip and other matters deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, as the Church judges, or in the outward exerciſe, if we do in theſe things as the Church does and practiſes.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:114611:22"/>
               <p n="13">13. Having premiſed thus much,
<note place="margin">Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Judgment anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> come we now to more particular directions for the extent or manner of performing Submiſſion to the judgment of the Church, when ſhe hath declared it in Matters of <hi>Belief</hi> or <hi>Practiſe.</hi> As for the <hi>Submiſſion</hi> of Private judgment to the publick. 1. To all the determinations of the Church we ow Submiſſion by aſſent and belief conditional, and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory at the leaſt, which being given with reſervation for evidence out of Gods Word, does both acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the Autority of our Paſtors and Teachers, and withall reſerve unto God his due. 2. In matters of Faith and Religious Worſhip, we cannot ſubmit to any company of Men, by reſignation of our judgment and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, or ſtanding bound to receive for Faith and Worſhip, all that they ſhal define and impoſe for ſuch; for ſuch reſignation gives to Man, what is due to God, and ſtands excluded by the condition (as above ſhewn) of the Autority, which is not Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and alſo by the condition of the Matter, (Faith and Worſhip) of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114611:23"/>high concernment to our own Souls, and to be accounted for by our ſelves, who therefore ſtand bound to make preſent and diligent ſearch for that evidence and demonſtration from Gods Word, upon which we may finally and ſecurely ſtay our judgments and belief in ſuch matters. 3. In other Matters of Opinion and Credibility, or of Diſcipline and Rites, which the Church determins and propoſes for ſuch, as there is more cauſe for ready conformity of judgment, ſo is there more ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or leſs danger in it; for ſuch Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are either not determined by Scripture in particular, or not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable but by ſeveral conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Only this conformity is yeilded ſtil with a reſervation for any ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidence or demonſtration of Truth to the contrary: elſe, til that come, our conformity remains ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; for here's the difference of conforming in the former points of Catholique faith or worſhip, and theſe later of Opinion, Diſcipline, Rites; that, when the former are propoſed to our belief and practice,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114611:23"/>we reſt not ſecure til we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtation or evidence that they are ſo; but in the other we ſubmit with ſecurity, til we have evidence that they are not ſo, as Autority hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. Indeed in matters of Diſcipline, and Ceremony (though in themſelves of ſmall concernment) great oppoſition hath often been made to the judgment and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Autority: of which I ſhal ſpeak a litle below under the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of <hi>Practice</hi> in ſuch matters; and, in the mean, let us ſee what Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be given in caſe of Privat Judgment juſtly diſſenting from the Publike.</p>
               <p n="14">14.
<note place="margin">Of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing a diſſent of Judgment in peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> If therfore it come to that (as poſſibly it may) yet for preſerving of due ſubmiſſion, take care, 1. That our diſſenting be not upon any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, or equalling our privat judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the publique, and autorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive judgment of the Church (for this wil be abſolutely againſt that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional &amp; preparatory belief or aſſent with which we are to receive all her determinations) but upon the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a greater Autority on our
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114611:24"/>ſide, <hi>viz.</hi> the demonſtration of Truth from Gods Word, or primitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Catholique Church; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which is of more Autority then the preſent Governours of the Church. 2. That the diſſenting of privat judgment be only in order to a mans own believing and delivering of his own ſoul, for which he is to give account, not to any inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate publiſhing of it to others; for, the light of Reaſon, though it may not be put out, yet may, and often ought to be concealed, and a mans privat judgment ſilenced in ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the publique. 3. If he publiſh or make known his diſſenting, it ought to be by modeſt propoſal to his Superiours, not by clamours againſt the Church, to a diſturbance of the peace of it: much leſs by force or tumult, as the manner of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries hath uſually been; for if he cannot internally acquieſce in the judgment of the Church, yet ought he to ſubmit, as far as poſſible, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, and to ſuffer for it, if need be.</p>
               <p n="15">15.
<note place="margin">Whether in al Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Caſes?</note> But here a queſtion may be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114611:24"/>made about theſe matters, in which we were ſaid to have evidence of Scripture, and Primitive conſent; if a Church ſhould ſo far err as to judg contrary to theſe, as for the error of <hi>Monothelites</hi> or <hi>Eutychians,</hi> or for the worſhiping of Images, or any Creature with Religious worſhip, muſt a man ſubmit with ſilence in ſuch a caſe? I anſwer; The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Word, being by that Church according to Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance called to publiſh the Goſpel and Counſels of God for ſalvation, ought to propoſe their contrary judgment and belief to their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors ſo erring; if they reform, it is wel; if not, the other ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare theſe Counſels of God; for in this caſe they have greater Autority (as was ſaid) on their ſide, and may ſay to the Governours of the Viſible Church, as the Apoſtles did to the great Councel, <hi>Whether it be more right to hearken to you or to God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. And to this caſe I refer that other erroneous principle of belief (the mother of Error and Apoſtacie) that al the Members of the Church
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114611:25"/>are bound to receive for Catholike Faith and Chriſtian Worſhip all that the Church whereof they are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers propoſes to them for ſuch; herein we had, and all that are ſtil of the Roman Communion, have cauſe to complain of that Church, and to declare diſſent of judgment from it, which not only impoſes <hi>Purgatory, Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and ſuch novel errors for Articles of the Catholike faith, and commands <hi>Image-worſhip</hi> as lawful and pleaſing to God; but alſo holds all the Members thereof bound to that former principle of miſ-belief, in a blind receiving all for faith and worſhip, that ſhal be ſo propoſed to them.</p>
               <p n="16">16.
<note place="margin">The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miitting of Doctrine and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to the cenſure of the Church.</note> And this which hath been ſaid will alſo ſpeak the meaning of that ſubmiſſion, which we profeſs to yeild, when we uſually ſay (and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe) We ſubmit our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Doctrine, or Writings to the cenſure of the Church: for 1. this is not a reſignation of judgment in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of believing, but a ſubmiſſion in regard of the publiſhing it, a putting it to the permiſſion of the Church,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114611:25"/>whether ſuch Doctrine, or Writings ſhall ſtand publiſhed or be ſilenced. 2. And this not in all things ſimply; for no Man can ſubmit his Judgment and Doctrine to any Company of Men, when he believeth and teacheth the prime Articles of Catholick Faith, into which all Chriſtians are baptized, or the immediat conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of them, which are evident to all that can uſe Reaſon and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the expreſs commands of God concerning Religious Worſhip; but it is in things more queſtionable, not plainly determined in Scripture, and though deducible from ſome confeſſed Article, or expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, yet by divers Conſequences. As in the firſt kind, the Church hath power to ſilence and cenſure any, that teach contrary to ſuch Articles, or Commandments, but cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to teach them. So in the ſecond ſhe hath power to ſilence any, that teach contrary to her declared Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in them. For it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed that the Church hath power to over-rule and reſtrain the exerciſe of any mans Miniſtry, in order to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114611:26"/>common peace and ſafety, ſhe being anſwerable for others, as wel as for him, whom ſhe reſtrains in publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his private judgment or belief to others.</p>

<note place="margin">Submiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, or Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> Thus much of Submiſſion of <hi>Judgment</hi> in matters of Belief or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, either in conforming to the Judgment and determination of the Church therein declared, or in a fair and peaceable diſſenting.

Now for Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Conformity in matters of practice, we muſt remember ſuch matters were of different ſorts and concernments, <hi>(Worſhip, Adoration, Diſcipline, Order, Ceremony)</hi> and then we have a double Caution, 1.

<note place="margin">Not all agreed about the chief ground of their belief.</note> But they are not all agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this ground of Belief, <hi>(Papal infallibility)</hi> for though it be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly profeſſed, and maintained in their Schools, eſpecially where the

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114611:38"/>ſome urging obedience to them, ſome refuſing, and ſhewing their Reaſons for their diſſenting; which may be ſeen drawn up in a book ſet out by Mr. <hi>William Howard,</hi> one of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion, and do ſpeak the reaſonableneſs of what is ſaid by us, for the judgment of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion allowed to private perſons, or Inferiours.</p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114611:38"/>he ſent forth ſuch definitive ſentence, I know not; but me thinks, in buſineſs of ſuch concernment to the Church and Chriſtian people, it ſhould have beſeemed him to give his judgment not car eleſly as a private Doctor, but as the Paſtor, General of the Church, and it had been worth his pains to go up to his chair for infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble determination; and if he did it not then, when ſo much cauſe, ſo much time to do it, when ſhall any man ever know certainly that the Pope defined or ſpake ſuch or ſuch a thing in his chair, that there may be ſure ground for belief and obedience?</p>

<note place="margin">Difference about Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Infalli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bility.</note> treating of the Popes Infallibility ſets down ſeverall opinions about it, of which this is one: <hi>That the Pope may be an Heretick and teach Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;</hi> This opinion he will not ſay is <hi>fully Heretical, becauſe they are tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the Church that hold it,</hi> but <hi>Haereſi proxima, at next door to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie:</hi> Yet as neer as it is to Hereſie, it is the ſentence generally of the Popiſh Church in <hi>France,</hi> and other places too: and ſee their agreement.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114611:39"/>This may not be taught at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the contrary of it at <hi>Paris.</hi> Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this Party hath unanſwerable reaſons and arguments for rejecting the Infallibility of the Papal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſetting up a General Councel above him, which would be good out of the mouth of a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant: Yet they alſo when they have to deal with Proteſtants, tell of the <hi>Infallible guidance</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> of the Pope as Vicar of Chriſt, and the viſible Head of his Church, and boaſt of their Church as <hi>built upon the Rock;</hi> in all which they thwart themſelves; for what privilege (of <hi>Infallibility</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) can the <hi>Roman</hi> Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to above other, but by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and then muſt it be derived by his ſuppoſed ſucceſſors the Biſhops of that Church? or how can they affirm the Pope to be <hi>Head,</hi> and deny him the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> or ſay a Councel is above him? or how apply that promiſe of <hi>the Rock</hi> to their Church, but by allowing S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſo his ſucceſſors to be that <hi>Rock,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to give the ſtability and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114611:39"/>to their Church, if that place prove any to be in it? This Party indeed will ſay, they make the Pope but a Miniſterial Head to the Church. Which how it reconciles the premiſes, or ſaves all they pretend to by the Pope, I ſee not; but ſurely it ſets them at a wide difference with their fellow Catholicks who are of a contrary perſwaſion. Let them agree it among themſelves: yet note we <hi>their diſagreement</hi> in points of ſuch high concernment, as touch the very ground-work of their Faith; and conſequently <hi>their uncertainty</hi> where to ſtate the infallibility: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>their unreaſonableneſs</hi> in exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (upon that pretence of <hi>infallible guidance</hi>) abſolute ſubmiſſion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to all things defined and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by that Church: and laſtly, <hi>their vanity</hi> in thinking to ſatisfie us with ſaying, They all agree in yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubmiſſion to all, that is defined by General Councels; and that the Differences we object to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Pope</hi> and Councel are not defined.</p>
               <p n="34">34. For firſt, they muſt not here
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114611:40"/>put us off with <hi>Submiſsion of Silence or external peaceable ſubjection</hi> (which requires not that infallible guidance the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> boaſts of, but an Autoritative judgment, or unappealeable Autority, which we quarrel not, if well ſtated, as will appear preſently) but they muſt ſpeak that agreement of theirs in yeilding <hi>Submiſsion of belief,</hi> and then it will not ſerve their turns to tell us, when we charge them with diſagreement in the grounds of their belief, that they all <hi>agree in yeilding Submiſsion,</hi> &amp;c. For ſeeing <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgment</hi> is the ground with them of that ſubmiſſion of belief, and they cannot agree how that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility accrews, or where it is to be ſtated in Councel, Pope, or partly in both (the reaſons of the one part being ſufficient to deſtroy the other) it muſt needs appear how much they diſagree in and about the very ground-work of their belief. They would think it ſtrange to hear us ſay, We and they do not diſagree in the grounds of our <hi>belief,</hi> becauſe we both agree in theſe Generals, <hi>That
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114611:40"/>all Divine Revelation is to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> yea, <hi>All that is revealed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ought to be believed;</hi> for if we enquire farther into the <hi>Means</hi> of conveying Divine Revelation, we cannot admit Tradition in ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and uncertain a ſenſe, as they do: or if look into the <hi>Meaning</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we cannot allow of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Infallible Judg or Interpreter; and they ſtick not to call us Hereticks for our diſagreement with them. So for their Principle in which they boaſt of their Univerſall agreement, <hi>(Submiſsion to all that is defined)</hi> if we enquire into the reaſon and ground of it <hi>(Infallible Judgment in their definitions)</hi> we find wide diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and contrary perſwaſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; and <hi>Bell.</hi> could find in his heart to make them Hereticks, that are againſt ſtating the Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Pope, and therefore call'd their Perſwaſion <hi>Haereſi Proxima, next door to Hereſie,</hi> as we heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove: and mark his reaſon there why it is not <hi>propriè haeretica,</hi> fully and properly ſo, <hi>Nam adhuc ab Eccleſiâ tolerantur</hi>—They are ſtill
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114611:41"/>tolerated of the Church, that hold it: A reaſon why he might not ſpeak as he thought; He thought it He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie no queſtion, but might not call it ſo, for ſaving the Union of their Church. Union and Agreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians is to be ſought for by all fair means, and to be held up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all juſt grounds: and in order to it, Submiſſion unto Autority is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and Toleration again from Autority may be ſometime and in ſome things needful; But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> boaſting of her Unity, and the means ſhe hath for it (Infallible Judgment in her Definitions) and thereupon requiring not only exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or peaceable ſubjection, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of belief, may be aſhamed for preſerving of her Unity to tolerat ſuch different perſwaſions or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, ſo neer unto Hereſie. And this alſo ſhews the Vanity of what they farther ſay, that the points they differ in (as whether a Pope be above a Councel, whether Infallible, &amp;c.) are not defined, and therefore gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſubmiſſion of belief, or uniform agreement is not required: Why
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114611:41"/>then ſay we, is that Doctrine tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongſt them, that is <hi>proxima Haereſi, ſo neer to Hereſie,</hi> as we heard above? Why is not that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and ſtated, which is the ground of believing all other things that are defined? The reaſon is plain; The Pope knows well enough if thoſe points were defined one way, they would not be generally believed, and that it is better to have them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled in privat into the minds of Men by his truſty Emiſſaries, then to have them publickly defined, and more for his advantage to have men brought to a <hi>perſwaſion</hi> of them in favoar of his power, then to hazard the peremptory <hi>belief</hi> of them either way. Other means there are, the chains of force and policy to hold all together, and I doubt not, but many are kept from revolting, whoſe Learning and Conſcience ſhews them a more excellent way, then that of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Some there are, as I hear,
<note place="margin">Of unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealable Autority.</note> of the more moderat ſort of <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> which will not now ſeem to contend for an <hi>Infallible Judgment</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:114611:42"/>in their Church, but to be content with an <hi>unappealable Autority.</hi> This may be good Doctrine at <hi>Paris,</hi> but not at <hi>Rome;</hi> and we may farther ſay, that ſuch Autority or Autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Judgment, being rightly ſtated (for it muſt be placed ſome where) as it hurts not us, ſo doth it not help them.</p>
               <p>For 1. they forſake the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work or formall reaſon of their <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> which is the Autority and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their Church; and it muſt be either Infallible, or not that thing into which their Faith can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved; for albeit ſuch an <hi>anap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealable Autority</hi> may in ſome ſort provide for <hi>External peace,</hi> yet can it not certainly and finally ſtay belief. 2. There may the ſame Objections be made againſt it, which they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reproach us with for want of that pretended Infallibility: <hi>viz.</hi> That men are ſo left to their own reaſon, That there is not without it ſufficient means for Peace and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; (of which <hi>Sect.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14. of the former book) for although when we diſſent from that <hi>unappeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114611:42"/>Autority,</hi> in matter of <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Opinion,</hi> we be not happily bound to diſcover it, at leaſt to the diſturbance of the Peace of the Church as above ſaid: Yet if the error be in commanding ſomthing for Religious <hi>Worſhip</hi> (as adoration of Sacrament or Images) that muſt needs diſcover and ſhew it ſelf in outward practiſe, the <hi>unappealable Autority</hi> cannot ſecure the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Submiſſion or compliance. In Civil affairs indeed <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nappealable Autority</hi> may abſolutely require ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Submiſſion, becauſe by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the wrong Judgment or Sentence of ſuch Autority, the things we recede from for peace ſake, are but Temporals, and in our own power to diſpoſe of; but it is not ſo in the Matters of the Soul and Conſcience, in the poims of Belief and Worſhip, in which we muſt have the Evidence of that, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly Infallible, to ſtay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="36">36. But what if men will be perverſe (as we have ſeen in theſe dayes) to pretend error &amp; ſuperſtition in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:114611:43"/>where there is none? Who ſhall judge?
<note place="margin">VVho ſhall judge?</note> They that ſo oft put this queſtion to us, cannot well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it themſelves; for who ſhall judge, ſay we to them? Pope or Councel? they cannot agree it where the Infallibility reſts; and if either or both of them muſt judg, ſhall their judgment be taken for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible? Neither are they here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, ſome contending for <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> ſome content with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nappealable</hi> Autority. As for us, we anſwer Unanimouſly: The Church ſhall judg (be it National or Univerſal) and take order with ſuch perſons; by the <hi>Church</hi> here we mean the Guides and Governours that have public Judgment and Autority in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very National Church, or in the Catholic aſſembled in a General Councel; and by <hi>Judging,</hi> we mean their defining or demonſtrating the Truth, according to the Infallible <hi>Rule</hi> of Gods Word, and their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencing of Perſons refractory, to due puniſhment. So the Church ſhall judg, either to the convincing and ſatisfying, or to the cenſuring and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:114611:43"/>puniſhing of ſuch Perſons: who are to anſwer unto God alſo for their diſobedience. For the Church or Public Autority, as it hath the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>Judgment</hi> above all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour or privat perſons, ſo of <hi>Power</hi> too, to proceed according to that Judgment againſt the obſtinate. No other means of reſtraint had the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, as was inſinuated, <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. of the former book.</p>
               <p>To conclude. This <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nappealable</hi> and not <hi>Infallible Autority,</hi> as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt with the main Principle of <hi>Romiſh</hi> belief, ſo may it well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ſtand with any thing aſſerted by us: and were it ſtated aright (not in the Pope, but in every National Church immediately, and in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councel finally) I ſuppoſe, there needed not be any matter of difference about it.

               <p>THat the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reformation was not regular and warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but carried againſt the conſent of the Biſhops of this Land, is the uſual reproach of the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> It was infinuated in the 4. <hi>Section</hi> of the former book, That the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was begun under <hi>Hen.</hi> and perfected under Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> not without a juſt National Synod; and that in the Reformation under <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. there was no diſplacing of Biſhops, but all was paſſed by general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. That late <hi>Romiſh</hi> Convert, as he pretends himſelf to be, that wrote the reproachful Pamphlet, Entituled, <hi>The Obit of Prelatic Proteſtancie,</hi> took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what I had ſaid, and returns the reproach double upon us, ſaying: <hi>All the Biſhops of this Nation were

               <p>We will conſider then, how the Reformation was begun, carried on and perfected; which will appear to be ſo done as the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> can have no juſt cauſe to reprove, nor the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or any Sectaries to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the like.</p>
               <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion begun under <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.</note> The Firſt Reformation began under <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. in the ejection of Papal jurisdiction with ſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious abuſes. And here I muſt firſt ſay, and deſire the Reader to take notice, that to this firſt &amp; main point of Reformation, the ejecting of that forrein Jurisdiction, there needed no vote of National Synod, or conſent of Biſhops: the King himſelf being a ſufficient and competent Judg in that cauſe of Vindicating his own Rights, upon which that Papal juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was a plain Uſurpation. And
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:114611:45"/>therefore the like had been often done by Kings of this Realm, before <hi>Hen.</hi>

But Secondly, we can ſay, and that moſt truly, that it was carryed with the general conſent of the Biſhops of this Land in ful Synod, decreeing not a <hi>breach,</hi> but the caſting off and renouncing of Papal ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, upon which the <hi>firſt breach</hi> followed; and ſo <hi>Saunders</hi> calls it <hi>Schiſma Henricianum,</hi> King <hi>Henries Schiſme.</hi>

Now if <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will ſay; Thoſe Biſhops and the reſt of the Clergy aſſembled in that Synod were of their <hi>party,</hi> becauſe moſt of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrine was ſtill reteined; then let them ſay, that their <hi>Party</hi> firſt made the <hi>Breach,</hi> and ceaſe to lay any imputation upon us for it, or for doing the like upon greater cauſe under Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> however, their <hi>Party</hi> or Ours, they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the <hi>firſt-breach</hi> was then made, and the Reformation then begun,

<note place="margin">Biſhops at Liberty.</note> 
                  <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Holdgate,</hi> together with <hi>Thirlby</hi> and divers other Biſhops made in King <hi>Henries</hi> time, continuing in their places unmoleſted all King <hi>Edwards</hi> reign; As for thoſe few, who at laſt were removed (viz. <hi>Boner, Gardiner, Heath.

Neither can I find that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:114611:46"/>any of them, during that time, was excluded from ſitting in Parliament, there being indeed no cauſe for it; for They had all taken the Oath of Supremacy, to the renouncing of Papal power and Jurisdiction, the form of which Oath is ſet down in <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments.</hi> They did alſo generally receive thoſe few injunctions, ſent out for Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as we ſhall hear preſently.

<note place="margin">National Synod.</note> If now it be asked, where is the judgment of a National Synod to warrant. King <hi>Edwards</hi> Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

What I ſpeak of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that it was not done <hi>without the judgment of a National Synod,</hi> did chiefly relate to the Synod under King <hi>Henry,</hi> which, as I ſaid, began the Reformation, and to the Synod under Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> which perfected it. In the firſt was the main Annoyance, and cauſe of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the Church, removed by caſting out the uſurped Papal Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, with ſome dependances of it; but in the latter Synod, the whole work (carried on under King <hi>Edw:</hi> according to the difficulties and ſhortneſs of his reign) was compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhewing it ſelf in an Uniform body of Doctrine, voted and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the 39.

<note place="margin">Title of Supreme Head.</note> For the work done in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, if any thing did run out of Square, through the ſwelling Title of <hi>Supreme Head,</hi> ſtretched a little, perchance, by ſome beyond his Line, the thanks are firſt due to Thoſe, whom they of the Popiſh party account theirs: I mean thoſe Biſhops and Clergy under <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. who may ſeem at leaſt in words and expreſſion to have over-done their work, not in that part which they denyed to the Pope, (for none could have written better againſt that uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Papal Supremacie then Biſhop <hi>Gardiner, Tonſtal</hi> and others) but in that which they attributed to the King.

<note place="margin">VVhether abuſed in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Now conſidering what was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready granted under <hi>Henr.</hi> 8. and ſworn to again under <hi>Edw:</hi> 6. by the Biſhops and Clergie of this Nation; conſidering alſo, the King (although of admirable piety and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond his years, yet) being under age, and ſo under Protection, it could be no marvel if the power of thoſe Lay-perſons, who ruled in chief had thereby the greater influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Affairs of the Time. And however the Kings Autority, under pretence of that Title and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, as it ſeems, was abuſed in diſpoſing of Church-means, and diverting them to private gain, yet I cannot find it to have been abuſed in this Reformation, as to the point of Gods Worſhip and Religion it ſelf; but muſt acknowledge the great and good Providence of God in it, that notwithſtanding the difficulties and prejudices of the time, the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Religion was fairly carryed on; and that is the third thing I have to ſay, That the Reformation
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114611:48"/>under King <hi>Edward</hi> (to the aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Image-Worſhip,</hi> the reſtoring of the <hi>Liturgie in a known Tongue,</hi> and <hi>Communion in both kinds,</hi> with that which followed thereupon, the aboliſhing of <hi>Romiſh Maſsings;</hi> for herein was the main of K. <hi>Edwards</hi> Reformation) was warrantably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and carryed on. For the clearing of which, as to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that did it, I have theſe things to ſay.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Firſt,
<note place="margin">Synodical Vote how neceſſary in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fineſs.</note> Reformation of Gods Worſhip may be warrantably done without a foregoing Synodical Vote. Synods indeed are the moſt prudential and ſafe way of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Church-Affairs, where there is not juſt and apparent cauſe of fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more danger from the perſons which are to be convocated, and the times in which they are to aſſemble. To this purpoſe ſounds that known complaint of <hi>Greg. Nazianzen, That he ſaw no good end of Councels,</hi> which he ſpoke not abſolutely, but with reſpect to the Times and Perſons as they ſtood then affected, by reaſon of the prevailing faction of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114611:49"/>
                  <hi>Arrians,</hi> who by their number and cunning made advantage often of the Councels held in thoſe times. Now ſeeing the office of Biſhops and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church, as to this point of Reformation, is <hi>directive,</hi> either in or out of Synod, and the more convenient way of the two for giving out that direction, is by their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſulting in Synod, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prince, whoſe power or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is <hi>Imperative</hi> and <hi>Coactive</hi> for eſtabliſhing by Laws and Penalties, what is evidenced to Him, hath great reaſon to receive his direction from the Paſtors of the Church aſſembled in Synod. But he is not ſimply and always bound, to take his direction thus, by any Law of God or Man; for if by the Law of God he ſtand bound to eſtabliſh within his own Dominions, whatſoever is evidenced to him by faithful Biſhops, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men of the Church, to be the Law of Chriſt (ſuch as were the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned points of Reformation, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently conſonant to Scripture and primitive Antiquity) ſhall he not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his known duty, till the Vote of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114611:49"/>a Major part of a Synod give him leave to do it? The change of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for the worſe is ſtil charged upon the evil Kings in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and the Reforming it again is recorded to the praiſe of good Kings: which ſhews this Obligation of Duty upon every Prince, and the examples of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah,</hi> who were more forward in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Gods Worſhip then the Prieſts, do warrant the forward piety of our yong <hi>Joſiah,</hi> K. <hi>Edward.</hi> And this is alſo approved by that, which many Chriſtian Emperors, and Kings have, to their great praiſe, done in the buſineſs of Religion, without or before the calling of a Councel, though not without the counſel and advice of faithful Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and learned Men. Of this point more below, when to ſpeak of Regal Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical things.</p>
               <p>Neither can we ſay, the Sovereign Prince is bound in the way of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence alwaies to receive his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from a Vote in Synod, eſpecially when there is juſt cauſe of fear, as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114611:50"/>above ſaid; but he may have greater reaſon to take advice from perſons free from the exceptions of Factions Intereſts, to which the moſt of them, that ſhould meet, are apparently obnoxious. And how far this was conſiderable in the beginning of King <hi>Edwards</hi> reign, or whether ſuch fear made them forbear to put it at firſt to a Synodical vote I cannot ſay; but this I have farther to ſay—</p>

<note place="margin">Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſent out at firſt by the King.</note> Secondly, In Reformation of Religion we muſt put a difference between <hi>proviſional Injunctions</hi> ſent out for the publick exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or Worſhip, and the <hi>Body or comprehenſion of Doctrine,</hi> or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in points of Religion.

               <p n="10">10.

               <p n="11">11.
<note place="margin">Thoſe Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſent out by advice of Biſhops, and were generally received of all the Biſhops.</note> Thirdly, They were ſent out

The ſumm of his Reaſonings is brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, 1.

From the judgment and doctrine generally of all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants; by whom the Pope is held to be Antichriſt, or Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: therefore we muſt acknowledg we received our Ordination and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (if from <hi>Rome</hi>) from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Antichriſt; by whom alſo they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Heretikes; therefore we can have no lawful calling from ſuch; by whom alſo the Orders there given are accounted <hi>Antichriſtian, abominable, Sacrilegious,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be lawfully received by us; Laſtly, by whom the <hi>Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

               <p n="4">4. Now although the different condition of ſome Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches doth not immediatly concern us, who have retained the regular way of Ordination by Biſhops, yet becauſe the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> make it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of reproach to us, and ſome in theſe Times (who covenanted the extirpation of Epiſcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ſought a defence in it for ſuch Schiſmatical attempts; we wil an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the former charge, and try what may be duly concluded upon the <hi>judgment</hi> and practice of other Reformed Churches.</p>

               <p n="7">7.

Oecolampad,</hi> &amp;c. were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> c. 4. and 9. and he could not but know, that <hi>Fulk,</hi> and <hi>Whitaker</hi> allowed of Biſhops here, and were ordained by them.</p>
               <p>But hence he concludes them all to be taken in a contrary tale, and put to a miſerable ſhift; <hi>For ask them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Whence came ye? who ſent you? they will tell us they came from the ſame ſtock and originall as the Paſtors of the Catholic</hi> (Roman) <hi>Church did; for their firſt Doctors,</hi> Luther, Bucer, Zuinglius, <hi>were by them ordained Prieſts; ask them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114611:61"/>how can they account that to be a lawfull calling, which is derived from the Miniſters of Antichriſt? they will not ſtick to defy thoſe Orders and Ordinations, and preſently flie to an extraordinary vocation.</hi> So he c. 9. p. 323. 324. And yet this ſeeming contradiction is very reconcilable. For when they reject the Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons received from <hi>Romiſh</hi> Biſhops as corrupt and Antichriſtian, they do it not ſimply, as if they were Null or none at all; but in regard of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall abuſes, eſpecially that great and ſacrilegious depravation of giving ſuch a ſacrificing power, and placing the Prieſtly function chiefly in it. Therefore ſo far as the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Ordinations pretend to give that power (with other ſuperadded abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) they are juſtly condemned and rejected: but in as much as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain withall the words of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall commiſſon, <hi>Receive the holy Ghoſt, whoſe ſins ye remit,</hi> &amp;c (which give the power <hi>of the Miniſtery of reconciliation,</hi> in the diſpenſing of the Word and Sacraments of the Goſpel) they are valid and good, and

The Doctrine of Faith and Life, the due profeſſion of which makes a man a Member of the <hi>Viſible Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church,</hi> and the true belief and practiſe of which makes him a lively Member of the true <hi>Symbolical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church,</hi> that which we believe in the Creed, that which is the true myſtical body of Chriſt. 2. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Miniſtery and Government in the Church, for bringing of Men to that due profeſſion of Doctrine, and ſo on to be true &amp; lively Members of the body of Chriſt, and for holding them in the Unity of faith. To this end Paſtors and Teachers (in whom
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:114611:63"/>that Miniſtery and Government reſts) are given by our Saviour, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Concerning theſe, two things are clear. Firſt, that although <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts</hi> there mentioned, and taken in a ſtricter ſenſe, were only <hi>then</hi> given and for <hi>thoſe Times,</hi> yet <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> were given, to continue to the worlds end. The purpoſe for which he gave them, expreſſed <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1. doth imply ſo much, and ſo doth his Commiſſion given to them, <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo I ſend you,</hi> S.

Secondly, That this <hi>giving</hi> or <hi>ſending.</hi> of Paſtors, was to be continued by ſuch as our Saviour appointed, and his Apoſtles after him; <hi>I ſend you,</hi> ſaith he: and accordingly they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this power, of ſending or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining Paſtors, unto the hands of ſpecial men, ſuch as <hi>Timothy, Titus, Sylvanus, Soſthenes, Clemens, Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus,</hi> &amp;c.

So then Faith and Charity joyn men formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, intrinſecally to Chriſt the Head, and Foundation: Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſerve to that end, and do that work miniſterially and extrinſecally. The firſt is the chief, and the doctrine that contains it neceſſarily concerns all the Members of that body in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as to their being ſuch; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them, I ſay, ſimply and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſably, as to the holding of the the Foundation, or Doctrines imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly fundamental, and alſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, as to the conſectary doctrines according to the revelation or means

<note place="margin">VVhether of choice, or of neceſsity.</note> Let me here add what Doctor <hi>Moulin,</hi> Son of <hi>Peter Moulin</hi> ſaith in behalf of the <hi>French</hi> Churches, and I add it chiefly for their ſakes, that gave him the occaſion; they were the <hi>Soottiſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who, at the beginning of theſe Troubles, rejected Biſhops, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination by them, and ſought to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:114611:66"/>juſtifie themſelves by the example of the <hi>French</hi> Churches. He therefore ſhews them, in his book then ſet out, what judgment and deſire the beſt in thoſe Churches have expreſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Biſhops, and that their not having them, was not of <hi>choice,</hi> but <hi>neceſsity:</hi> which he endeavours to demonſtrat by ſeveral reaſons drawn from the conſideration of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and of their condition under the Soveraign Power there. And to ſhew, if they might have their <hi>choice,</hi> they would willingly have Biſhops, he tells us, that <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Troyes, <hi>having abjured Popery, began to preach the pure Word of God, and ſent for the Elders of the Reformed Church, to know, whether they would confirm and acknowledg him for their Biſhop: which they all with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent did, ſubmitting themſelves to his obedience.</hi> And then adds: <hi>There is none I dare ſay, of all the Churches of</hi> France, <hi>but would do as much in the like caſe. None but would obey Biſhops, if Biſhops would reform and obey God. Till God extend ſo much mercy upon that Kingdome, the poor
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:114611:66"/>Churches will ſtay for the leiſure of the Biſhops</hi> (viz. <hi>which now poſſeſs the Sees, and are not Reformed) keeping themſelves in an eſtate fit for Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> Or, as he had ſaid before, <hi>The Church of</hi> France, <hi>being under the Croſs, and without Biſhops, is a body prepared for Obedience, whenſoever the Popiſh Biſhops ſhall reform,</hi> in the 25. and 26. pag. of his book. But for thoſe that reject Biſhops when they may have them, he ſhews how they fall under the ſevere cenſures of <hi>Zanchy</hi> and <hi>Calvin, Teſtor me coram Deo</hi>—ſaith <hi>Zanchy, I proteſt before God and in my Conſcience, that I hold them no better then Schiſmaticks, that account or make it a part of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church to have no Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yea, they are worthy</hi> (ſaith <hi>Calvin) of any execration that will not ſubmit themſelves unto that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erarchy, that ſubmitteth it ſelf unto the Lord</hi>—Theſe cenſures he cites (in his 13. pag.) out of their Tracts <hi>De Reform.

               <p n="16">16. Now to <hi>Champny</hi>'s Argument <hi>(A true Church is not without true

But thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches have not true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors lawfully called, but only preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Elders, which are made by thoſe that have no power to ordain or ſend others, therefore they are no Churches.) Moulin</hi> would anſwer, and firſt grant with <hi>Calvin, That the World may be as wel without the Sun, as the Church without true Paſtors.</hi> l. 4. <hi>Inſt.</hi> c. 3. And farther, take the word <hi>True Paſtors,</hi> (that there be no ambiguity in it) for ſuch as are called lawfully, after the originall and ordinary way of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> for Biſhops, and thoſe that are ordained by Biſhops; He wil grant the propoſition true, of the whole Church, which is never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch; and alſo true of particular Churches, completed, perfected, and regularly formed. Such Churches he acknowledgeth the <hi>French</hi> are not, but in a ſtate imperfect, yet capable of a regular completion, and as it were, expecting of it. And therefore wil deny, that they are concluded by
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:114611:67"/>the former argument, to be no Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or not to belong to the Church of Chriſt, becauſe of that want or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Vocation or Ordination of their Paſtors.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Thoſe companies indeed of Chriſtians, who believed in <hi>India</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the preaching of <hi>Frumentius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Church of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they received Paſtors from the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> and that multitude which believed in <hi>Samaria</hi> upon the preaching of <hi>Philip,</hi> and were baptized by him, were indeed of the Church, and a Church of Chriſt, though not completed, til <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> went down with due Autority, to ſet all in order there. Accordingly we may account of thoſe Reformed Churches (which have not their Paſtors ſent and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained as from the beginning) as of Congregations not regularly form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as Churches not completed: not indeed without Paſtors altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as thoſe of <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi> at the firſt were, but having ſuch as they can, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as have (if we wil ſpeak properly) the Vocation on

                  <hi>Election</hi> of their reſpective Churches, (which is one thing in the calling of Paſtors) but not due <hi>Ordination,</hi> (which is the main thing in impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the exerciſe of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,) and ſo are Paſtors by a <hi>moral deſignation</hi> to the Office, rather then any <hi>real or due conſecration,</hi> which only is by thoſe hands, that have received the power of ſending or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining Paſtors, from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
               <p n="18">18. It muſt be granted, that the Vocation of ſuch Paſtors is deficient, and their Ordination irregular, and that not only by the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Canons</hi> in that behalf, but alſo by <hi>Apoſtolical Order</hi> and practice: Yet, becauſe they hold the <hi>Faith</hi> which is the chief point in the conſtitution of the Church, and have not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully departed from that Apoſtolical Order, and way of the Church, by the breach of <hi>Charity,</hi> in condemning and rejecting it, but do approve of it where it may be had, we cannot ſay that irregularity, or deficiency infers a plain Nullity in their Paſtors and Churches (as <hi>Champny</hi> will have
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:114611:68"/>it) but ſtands in a condition of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſupply or completion, and is in the mean time ſo far excuſable, as the want or not having of that Supply is of <hi>Neceſsity,</hi> and not of <hi>Choice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. But <hi>Champny</hi> will admit of no excuſe, either of <hi>irregularity</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in the calling ſo their Paſtors, or of <hi>Neceſsity</hi> pleaded as the cauſe enforcing it. But proceeds to prove ſuch a nullity in their Ordinations, that it concludes them to have no Paſtors at all, and no Church. This argument he purſues chiefly againſt Doctor <hi>Field,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the power of Biſhops and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters as to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> who (in the 3. book of the <hi>Church,</hi> cap. 39.) had endeavoured in behalf of the Reformed Churches that have not Biſhops, to ſhew that their Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions though not regular according to the way of the Church, yet were not ſimply invalid; and that by the Doctrine of the beſt Schoolmen, who held the Office of a Biſhop to be not a diſtinct Order, or to imprint a diſtinct Character, from that of the Prieſtly function; which alſo they proved by this inſtance: A Biſhop
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:114611:69"/>Ordained, <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> (i. e. who was not firſt made Presbyter) cannot either conſecrate the Sacrament, or Ordain others; but a Prieſt, or Presbyter ordained <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> may execute the office of the Deacon, by reaſon that the Superior Order con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teins in it ſelf the Inferior; whence Doctor <hi>Field</hi> would have it conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That Biſhop and Presbyter differ not in Order, or in the very power of Order, but in eminency and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of an Office to which <hi>Ordination</hi> and other performances, as <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, public abſolution,</hi> &amp;c. are reſerved: alſo that, when the antient Church declared Ordination by Presbyters to be void and null, it is to be underſtood according to the rigour of the Canons; not that all ſuch Ordinations were ſimply null, <hi>ex naturâ rei,</hi> and in themſelves, or not to be born with in any Caſe.</p>
               <p n="20">20. See we now what <hi>Champny</hi> replies to all this, and then conſider what may be reaſonably allowed, and ſaid as to this point. His anſwer is to this purpoſe, That thoſe School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:114611:69"/>if they hold not Epiſcopacy to be a diſtinct Order, yet ſay it is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct power; if not a different Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, yet a new Extenſion of the former Sacerdotal Character; and that the Argument from Ordination <hi>per ſaltum</hi> doth not diſprove the latter way. Laſtly that ſuch Presbyterian Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations were, in the judgment of the Ancient Church, Null <hi>ex naturâ rei,</hi> and not by the Eccleſiaſtical Canons only; for that judgment or ſentence of the Church was not a <hi>Conſtitutive</hi> decree (for then the beginning of it would appear in the Canons of the Ancient Councels) but only <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> of what was ſo in it ſelf from the beginning of the Church. This he in his 7. Chap.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Here ſomething is doubtful and queſtionable, ſomething clear and apparent. That Biſhops had a power or faculty to do ſomething which Presbyters could not (namely to ordain) is clear in Schoolmen and Fathers; but whether that power make the Epiſcopal function a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Order from the Prieſtly, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print a different ſacramental chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:114611:70"/>we leave it to the Schoolmen to diſpute. Alſo we grant that Biſhops receive and exerciſe that power (as <hi>Champny</hi> ſaith truly) not by a <hi>Moral deſignation</hi> only (as Judges and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in a State do for the time of their office, or as thoſe among the Presbyters ſeem to do, who are aſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſigned to ordain others) but by <hi>Real conſecration,</hi> or ſacred devoting them to that office or work of ordaining and ſending others. Which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, though it imprint not a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Character on the Soul (as the Romaniſts expreſs it) yet it gives to the Perſon ſo ordained &amp; devoted ſuch a faculty or habitude to that action or work, as cannot be taken from him; the reaſon of which we ſhall enquire below, where occaſion is given to ſpeak more of that which the Romaniſts call <hi>Character indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> in this point of Holy Orders. Furthermore, whether this office of Ordaining imply a power wholly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded to the Prieſtly function,
<note place="margin">Two wayes of conceiving the power of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Biſhops.</note> Ordaining imply a power wholly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded to the Prieſtly function, which is one way of conceiving it; or a faculty of exerciſing that power, ſuppoſed to be radicated or founded
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114611:70"/>in the Prieſtly Order, and diffuſed with it, by reſtraining it to certain perſons conſecrated for that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, it may be queſtioned. Doctor <hi>Field</hi> ſeeme plainly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it this latter way, and ſo do the Schoolmen alleged by him: and <hi>Champny</hi>'s expreſſion of their ſenſe by <hi>extention of the Sacerdotal Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,</hi> if it have any ſenſe, ſpeaks as much, <hi>viz.</hi> the dilating of that which was before in the Sacerdotal Order radically, by extending that Radical power unto a <hi>proxima poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> or immediat faculty in certain perſons conſecrated to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it, and keeping it reſtrained in all others of that Order, who are not ſo conſecrated and devoted to that great work of Ordaining and ſending others. Laſtly, whether we conceive of it as a power wholly ſuperadded, or as the reſtraint of a power diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it is clear that the exerciſe of that power, the performance of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination was ſetled upon certain and ſpeciall perſons (who were proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Biſhops and Chief Paſtors) by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical appointment and practice.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114611:71"/>Of which there are ſo clear footſteps in Scripture, ſuchapparent Monuments and Records in Antiquity, that it is no leſs then a wonder, any Learned Judicious Man ſhould think it could be otherwiſe: or conceive (as the Presbyterians generally) that this Order was afterwards ſet in the Church, as an humane (though pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) invention to avoid Schiſm and preſerve Unity, and not withall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it reaſonable to think the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did foreſee that Reaſon, and provide againſt it, when as we hear Saint <hi>Paul</hi> complaining of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. and Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> refers that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſetting Biſhops over Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to that very cauſe, pointing out that very time, when ſome ſaid, <hi>I am of Paul, I of Cephas.</hi>—</p>
               <p n="22">22. If therefor Doctor <hi>Field,</hi> when he anſwered that Ordinations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Biſhops were void according to the <hi>rigor of the ancient Canons,</hi> did mean that ſuch Ordinations offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only againſt Eccleſiaſtical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, we grant that <hi>Champny</hi> duly proves it otherwiſe, and do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg them tranſgreſſions not
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114611:71"/>only of Eccleſiaſtical but Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Conſtitution and Practice; but we are not therefore bound to yeild an utter nullity of them in all caſes, <hi>&amp; ex naturâ rei</hi> (as he contends) unleſs he can clearly demonſtrat this faculty or office of ordaining to ſtand in a diſtinct power wholly ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and not in the extenſion of the Prieſtly Order, or limiting of the exerciſe of that power, conceiv'd to be radically diffus'd with it. Thus indeed Doctor <hi>Field,</hi> as I ſaid, ſeems to conceive it, and thereupon to deny ſuch Ordination to be Null in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>ex naturâ rei,</hi> yet withal to hold, as may be gathered out of his 5. book, cap. 27. that this Order or limiting of the Power in the exerciſe of it to certain ſpecial perſons, was by Apoſtolical appointment.</p>
               <p n="23">23. And no queſtion the antient Church had reſpect to that Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical conſtitution, when ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſuch Ordinations without Biſhops, to be void and Null, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to that conſtitution; not defining whether they were void, <hi>ex naturâ rei,</hi> but declaring ſhe had
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:114611:72"/>good cauſe to account them void, and not to admit any to officiate, that did ſo wilfully tranſgreſs againſt Apoſtolical order and practice, and could have (there being Biſhops then at hand in every Nation, where Chriſtian Faith was profeſſed) no pretence of neceſſity or of looſing the band, by which the Apoſtles had reſtrained the exerciſe of that power to certain perſons thereunto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated. And if any Presbyter ſhould have heretofore preſumed to ordain within the Church of <hi>England,</hi> their Ordinations had deſerved to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of no otherwiſe then as void. And ſo within every Church completed, and regularly formed according to Apoſtolical Order, ought they to be accounted.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Now that I may draw to a Concluſion, and freely ſpeak what I think of the two forementioned wayes of conceiving the Ordaining power to be eſtated by the Apoſtles upon ſpecial and ſelect men, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Biſhops or chief Paſtors; I ſuppoſe the firſt way, (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it ſuperadded as a diſtinct
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:114611:72"/>power to their Prieſtly function) to be the clearer for ſecuring the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal function, and diſtinguiſhing it from the other: but the ſecond way (which conceives that power radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally diffuſed, and communicated in the very order of the Prieſtly fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and reſtrained to ſuch ſelect perſons in the exerciſe of it, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty or immediate power whereof they received by conſecration) I ſuppoſe to be more eaſie and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for a peaceable accord of the difference in hand, and yet ſafe enough for Epiſcopal Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="25">25. The firſt way conceives the Apoſtles, who had the whole power given them by Chriſt, (both the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Apoſtolical power, and that which was ordinary and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Church) did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this power ſeverally: That, which belonged to the office of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, to perſons choſen for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: That, which belonged to the Miniſtery of reconciliation, to all Paſtors or Presbyters: So likewiſe, That power of ſending and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:114611:73"/>others to theſe Offices was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated entirely unto ſpecial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, appointed and conſecrated to that work. This, as I ſaid, is more clear in the diſtinguiſhing of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Functions of holy Order. But the ſecond way, which eſtates the power or faculty of Ordaining upon ſpecial perſons, by reſtraining the exerciſe of it to them, ſeems (as above ſaid) to be more fair and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie for the making up this buſineſs of the Reformed Churches, which have Ordination without Biſhops; and yet to afford ſafety enough to Epiſcopal function and Ordination. For it firſt ſuppoſes that to be eſtabliſhed and ſecured by Apoſtolical Order, which none can tranſgreſs wilfully without Sacrilege: and conſequently it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges ſuch Ordinations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Biſhops to be irregular and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in regard of Apoſtolical order and conſtitution, and that they ought to receive a ſupply, completion, and confirmation by the impoſing of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops hands, before the perſons ſo Ordained can be admitted to officiat in a Church completed, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:114611:73"/>formed. Laſtly, by this way, whatſoever is ſpoken by S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in appearance favourable to the Presbyterian pretence, may be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reconciled to Truth: and by it may be anſwered alſo whatever is brought by <hi>Champny</hi> or others, to prove ſuch Ordinations utterly or <hi>ex naturâ rei</hi> null, and void in all caſes.</p>
               <p n="26">26. I will not trouble the Reader to hear any long Scholaſtick conteſt with <hi>Champny</hi> in the buſineſs; only I ſhal ſhew by one inſtance how well he hath acquitted himſelf in the defenſe of his aſſertion againſt the former ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, of a Biſhop ordained <hi>per ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and therefore not having power to ordain others, or conſecrate the Sacrament, becauſe he wants the Prieſtly Order.</p>
               <p>That which he replies to it returns more forcibly upon himſelf:
<note place="margin">A Biſhop <hi>per ſaltum</hi> cannot or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, and why.</note> 
                  <hi>Sicut ex eo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Even as,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becauſe the Prieſtly function is exerciſed both about the Myſtical body of Chriſt, in abſolving and binding, and alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Natural body of Chriſt in conſecrating of it, it doth not therefore
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:114611:74"/>follow there is a diverſe Order, but a diverſe power of the ſame Order.</hi> So the power of Ordaining, though it make not a diſtinct Order from that of the Prieſtly Function, yet is it a diſtinct power of Order—To this purpoſe he, <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 183, 184. But this comes not home to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> where it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the power of Ordaining is not given at all; becauſe the Prieſtly Order is wanting. This alſo returns more forcibly upon him by applying it thus according to his reaſoning: Even as the Powers of abſolving and conſecrating are diſtinct, yet both conteined within one Order of the Prieſtly function, ſo may the power of Ordaining, though diſtinct from the other, be formally and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately conteined within the Prieſtly function; and this is more then is required, more then is true; but thus much at leaſt he muſt by his own reaſoning allow, that it may be radically founded in that Order; and for want of that foundation it may be, that a Biſhop ordained <hi>per ſaltum</hi> cannot ordain others.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:114611:74"/>

Again, The reaſon ſaith he, why a Biſhop ſo ordained cannot Ordain or Conſecrate, is not <hi>quia Epiſcopatus non ſit diſtincta poteſtas à ſacerdotio, ſed quia eſſentialiter illud praeſupponit, ut poteſtas abſolven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di neceſſariò praeſupponit poteſtatem conſecrandi: not becauſe Epiſcopacy is not a diſtinct power from the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but becauſe that doth eſſentially pre-ſuppoſe this</hi> (which is very neer to the founding of the power of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination in the Prieſtly Order) <hi>even as the power of abſolving doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily praeſuppoſe the power of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> So he, <hi>ibid. pag.</hi> 184. Now albeit this latter aſſertion be falſe (as being grounded upon their placing <hi>the whole perfection of the Prieſtly Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> (ſo <hi>Champny</hi> there) in the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of the Body of Chriſt, when as the power of <hi>Abſolving</hi> is as immediat to that Order or Function, as the power of <hi>Conſecrating</hi> can be; yea, the <hi>Miniſtery</hi> of <hi>reconciliation</hi> doth expreſs the whole power of that function in Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. to which this phanſie of Romiſh Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing is a ſtranger: Albeit, I ſay,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:114611:75"/>that inſtance ſpeaks what is falſe, yet ſtil it returns in the application more forcibly upon him, if we reaſon thus; As the power of <hi>Abſolution</hi> neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuppoſes the power of <hi>conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> (which he laies down for a Truth) and yet are conteined in the ſame Order of the Prieſtly Function, ſo (for any thing that he ſayes) may the power of Ordaining which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily &amp; eſſentially preſuppoſes, as he ſayes, the power of Conſecrating, be conteined alſo with it in the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Order; though not formally and immediatly as the power of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution is, for that is ſtil more then is required or can be maintained, yet radically founded in it, and diffuſed with it.</p>
               <p n="28">28. The true reaſon, as I conceive, why Ordination of a Biſhop <hi>per ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> doth not give him power to <hi>conſecrate</hi> the Sacrament, or to <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve</hi> or to <hi>ordain</hi> others to thoſe Offices, is becauſe the <hi>Power of the Keyes,</hi> which includes all thoſe Powers and Offices, is received in the Prieſtly Function; which made me ſay, it is the more peaceable way,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:114611:75"/>and may probably be defended, that the power of Ordaining is diffuſed with the Prieſtly Office, or founded in it: and is in it, not immediatly and formally as a power ready for Act and exerciſe (as the power of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving and Miniſtring Sacraments is in it, to which the Prieſt hath parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and expreſs Ordination) but radically, and as <hi>in primâ potentiâ,</hi> the <hi>remote power;</hi> ſo as the faculty of exerciſing it, or the <hi>proxima po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia</hi> of it, is given to ſpecial men by Conſecration to the work, and that by Apoſtolical conſtitution. And in this ſenſe <hi>the extenſion of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal Character,</hi> (which <hi>Champny</hi> allows) may ſtand. Now that firſt and radical power can never be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reduced to Act or exerciſe in them that have not lawful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration to it, but by extreme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, through the utter failing of them that have; which whether it be poſſible I leave it to <hi>Champny</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
               <p n="29">29. As for the neceſſity, which thoſe Reformed Churches have pleaded in excuſe of this irregularity
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:114611:76"/>in their Ordinations, I ſhall not now enquire into it; Only I wiſh heartily, that they which have chief rule in thoſe Churches, did not think themſelves ſo far engaged to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue where they are; but that they would entertain a ſtronger appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the neceſſary concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Order, which was left in the Church by the Apoſtles, and continued alwayes and in all places, where the Chriſtian faith was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, till the laſt Age.</p>
               <p n="30">30. As for thoſe falſe Inferences which either Papiſt or Sectarie hath made from the different condition of thoſe Churches, to the ſeeming pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, it was my work to diſcover them; and now I ſhal give the Reader a brief of what hath been ſaid againſt them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the trouble he hath been hitherto put to by a tedious perplexity. I. That we Proteſtants of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church ſtand not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in this point of Ordination by Biſhops, received at firſt from <hi>Rome;</hi> Other Churches, ſevered from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion, have reteined
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:114611:76"/>Biſhops, and Ordination by them, and that derived from <hi>Rome;</hi> and thoſe Reformed Churches that have not, yet approve it in us, and have acknowledged their own defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, joyning with us in judgment, but differing in practice, for which neceſſity is alleged. II. We muſt not for that deficiency quit all fellowſhip with them or diſclaim them as no Churches, becauſe of <hi>Conſanguinit as Doctrine</hi> (as <hi>Tertul.</hi> phraſes it) <hi>the Kindred and alliance of Doctrine</hi> which is between us; for the bond or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in Faith and Charity binds the body of Chriſt together, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16. and that is the main in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the other point of Order, as it concerns the ſending and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe that ſhould teach and publiſh that Doctrine, and build up the body of the Church, ought moſt carefully to be obſerved according to Apoſtolical practice, which fixed that office upon ſpecial Select Perſons, called Biſhops, yet becauſe it is not ſo clear, whether it was fixed to their Perſons as a ſuperadded power,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:114611:77"/>or as the faculty of exerciſing that power, which, being conteined in the power of the Keyes, might with them be radically received in their Prieſtly Order; we cannot pronounce abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Nullity upon their Ordinations, eſpecially the caſe ſtanding with them as they plead. And becauſe it doth not appear that a bare want, or Deficiency, in the appointed Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Church, ſhould forfeit their belonging to the Church, where the main (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Doctrine of Faith</hi> and Life) is preſerved, and the other of <hi>Order</hi> not wilfully perverted to a breach of <hi>Charity</hi> with thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that have preſerved it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot judg them to be no Churches or Congregations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; but we look upon them as Churches not completed or regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly formed, and excuſe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects ſo far as they are enforced on them by neceſſity, and conclude them bound to ſeek their Completi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a ſupply of their defects from thoſe that have Biſhops, and hold the ancient Apoſtolike way of the Church. Laſtly ſeeing their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:114611:77"/>concerning Biſhops and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by them, where it may be had, is ſuch, and their excuſe of the want of it pleaded by neceſſity, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample can in no wiſe be alleged in defence of thoſe, who of late have rejected Biſhops and Ordination by them, nay ejected them, when they had them. We bleſs God, that we had the happy means of a regular Reformation; the more they have to anſwer for, that diſturbed our eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Order; but as for thoſe Churches which approve of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der where it is, and want it by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, rather then choice, we leave it to <hi>Champny</hi> and other <hi>Romaniſts</hi> to conclude deſperatly upon them, and all that are not in their way, enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the whole Church within their Communion; and judg of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans not ſo much by their Union to Chriſt by the bands of faith and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13.16. as to his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Vicar by ſubjection to him; for ſo they conceive of the Church of Chriſt as of a Society joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under one Paſtor, the Pope or Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and do accordingly
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:114611:78"/>define it, and acknowledg the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, making themſelves thereby <hi>Papiſts</hi> rather then <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and cutting off from the Church, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for defects <hi>in ritu Apoſtolico</hi> the Order left by our Saviour and his Apoſtles (which is the charge they have againſt the Reformed Churches that are without Biſhops) but alſo for failing <hi>ritu Romano,</hi> the not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving in this point of Ordination, the additional Rites and Papal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions uſed there; which is the charge they have againſt us, and for which they conclude we have no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops nor lawful Paſtors: as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear below.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

Or how can we think, that Chriſt ſhould leave the power of Ordaining Paſtors for the feeding of his Church, which he bought with his precious bloud, and for the diſpenſing of his holy Word and Sacraments, in the hand of his ſworn Enemy?</hi> c. 9. p. 320. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To this Argument I anſwer the more willingly, becauſe I ſee how
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:114611:79"/>Presbyterians generally, with thoſe of other Sects, ſuffer themſelves by ſuch inconſequencies and miſtakes to be abuſed into many inconveniencies, to the great diſturbance of the Church. Here are two points to be ſpoken to. 1. The Judgment of the Popes being Antichriſt. 2. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference againſt our Ordinations.</p>
               <p n="2">2.
<note place="margin">Of the opinion of the Pope being Antichriſt.</note> To the firſt, That there is much <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> doctrine taught in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> invented, broached, maintained by the Popes and others, that have been, and are chief in that Church, is moſt evident to any man that hath any reaſonable inſight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſtianity: and that they which hold and maintein ſuch doctrine are, and may be called <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> is not to be denyed, for ſo there are many <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> tels us of his time. But that the Pope is <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> is no point of our faith, none of the Articles of our Religion. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies indeed are matter of Faith, and ought to be believed, that they ſhall be fulfilled, before they come to paſs, and that they are fulfilled when the Scripture aſſures us they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:114611:79"/>are; but when it leaves us to gather the event, by ſigns delivered in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick expreſſions, and more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral terms, ſuch as is the deſcription of <hi>Antichriſts</hi> comming; then to ſay ſuch a prophecie is now fulfilled, or ſuch a State or Perſon is that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> is not the act of <hi>Faith,</hi> but the work of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> making a Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Inference, upon application of the ſigns and marks, deſcribing him in the prophecy, to ſuch or ſuch a Perſon or State.</p>
               <p n="3">3.
<note place="margin">VVhich admits ſeveral ſenſes.</note> Now as King <hi>James</hi> in his <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition</hi> to Chriſtian Princes falling upon this point (by occaſion of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie laid to his charge by thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Oath of Allegiance declared by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> to be againſt the Catholic Faith) purſues it indeed eagerly, and with a long diſcourſe, not as an Article of his Faith, but as a Problematical perſwaſion, to ſhew he could better and with more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Truth prove the Pope to be <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> then the Pope could prove him to be Heretick, or himſelf to have ſuch ſuperiority over Kings. So we muſt take that Aſſertion of our
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:114611:80"/>Writers <hi>(de Papâ Antichriſto)</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, not only in regard of our ſelves, whom they call and hold to be Heretikes, to ſay <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> agrees more properly to them, then Hereſie to us: but alſo in regard of all other Perſons or States, that have fallen under the ſuſpition of being <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> to ſay, Of all that yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the World, the ſigns and marks of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> agree moſt plainly to the Pope and Popedome. I cannot but ſay I am much inclined to think, as learned <hi>Zanchy</hi> ſeems to do in his Tract <hi>de fine Seculi,</hi> that, whatever is done already in the <hi>working of the Myſtery of Iniquity, the Antichriſt</hi> will be revealed in that Seat, and ſit in that Papal Chair.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Many Antichriſts, in a large and more remiſs ſenſe, there have been, and will go before the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of that great One; and a great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſuch there hath been in the Popedome already. <hi>Bernard</hi> and many other that lived within the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, diſcovered the appearance
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:114611:80"/>of Antichriſt in the Papal Court and ſpoke it. Indeed the <hi>Spirit of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> which Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, did work in the Hereticks of his time, (1. Ep. c. 4. v. 3.) who by <hi>Tertul.</hi> are called <hi>Praecurſores illius Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti Spiritus, the forerunners of that great Antichriſt, adverſ. Marc.</hi> l. 5. c. 16. that Spirit, I ſay, of Antichriſt, hath long wrought in the chief Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church; not only by reaſon of Heretical and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doctrine there taught, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that Principle of miſ-belief, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Infallibility,</hi> the ground of their faith or believing, then which no one can better fit the turn of Antichriſt, or be a readier way to Apoſtacy from Chriſt) but alſo by reaſon of exorbitant power there challenged and uſurped, firſt over all Biſhops in the Church of Chriſt (for which by Saint <hi>Gregories</hi> warrant we may ſtile the Pope the <hi>forerunner of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi>) then, over Kings and <hi>all that are called Gods.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:114611:81"/>draws it <hi>ad impoſsibile,</hi> or to <hi>this Abſurdity: Therefore Chriſt left his Church in the hand of his ſworn Enemy, giving him the power of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, or providing Paſtors for his Church</hi>— and tels us, The Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches do therefore abhor the Orders, and reject all things elſe, that come from <hi>Rome.</hi>

So that, whatever Proteſtants judg now of the Pope, it cannot prejudice the Ordination, either of our firſt <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Biſhops by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great (who mainly reſiſted the beginnings of Papal Antichriſtianiſme in <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>) or of our firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Biſhops, <hi>Cranmer, Latimer</hi> or others, for the Pope was then eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and the Ordainers of thoſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſworn againſt him: and ſo not to be accounted Miniſters of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>To conclude; conſidering what was ſaid above of the miniſterial acts of <hi>Judas,</hi> and others that were in place and office, the charge of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſme (taken in any ſenſe, ſtrictly or remiſly) cannot preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice our judgment of the now <hi>Romiſh</hi> Ordinations, which we allow to be valid ſtill, as to the ſubſtance of the Order appointed and ſetled in the Church by our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.

<note place="margin">The ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice from our char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</note> His next Argument is from the charge of Hereſie laid by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants upon thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, from which he concludes our plea, of receiving Ordination by them, muſt fall by our own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for Orders cannot lawfully be received from Hereticks c. 9. 326. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That we may more fairly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the clearing of this difficulty, we muſt premiſe, that we admit the diſtinction here between <hi>Legitimum</hi> and <hi>Legitimè,</hi> between <hi>Lawful</hi> or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Orders, and Orders <hi>Lawfully</hi> given or received: the firſt implyes the power of given, which <hi>Romaniſts</hi> acknowledg to remain in Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, the other ſpeaks the due and lawful uſe of that power, which is denyed to be in thoſe, that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:114611:85"/>are in Hereſie or Schiſme. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe Hereticks and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks being actually divided from the Unity of the Church muſt needs loſe the lawful uſe of that power, and all other Eccleſiaſtical miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not the power it ſelf, which follows a <hi>Character</hi> that is <hi>indelible,</hi> as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> expreſs it; We admit though not a Sacramental character ſtampt upon the Soul of the Ordained, as they wil have it, yet ſuch a diſpoſition or power, cleaving to his perſon, for the doing of that he is ordained to, that it is not loſt by Hereſie or Schiſm, nor to be rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated upon the return, or reſtoring of that Perſon.</p>
               <p n="12">12. This premiſed we have two points to ſpeak to; Firſt, how the charge of Hereſies laid on thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> then how the lawful uſe of Orders may be ſupplyed by the reſtoring of the Perſon, though at firſt they were not lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given: and ſo by both theſe, we ſhall have a double anſwer to the Argument above.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, we muſt note, that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:114611:85"/>Hereſie is conſidered in regard of the <hi>Matter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">VVhat ſort of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie takes away law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful uſe of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> or of the <hi>Declaration</hi> of the Church: and this according to the Apoſtles ſpeech, to <hi>Tit.</hi> c. 3.10. <hi>A man that is an Heretick</hi>— is ſo firſt, before he be <hi>rejected,</hi> or declared ſo. Hereſies alſo much differ in regard of the <hi>Matter,</hi> by which ſome may be ſo immediatly fundamental, as the Hereſie of the <hi>Arrians</hi> and ſome other, that it doth <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> before any ſentence or declaration of the Church, cut off or divide the Perſon ſo Heretical from the Union of the true Catholic Church, (becauſe it divides him from the Foundation) &amp; from being actual Member of the Viſible Church, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Notoriety of ſuch Hereſie, ſo contrary to the Foundation; and alſo long ſince declared againſt by the Ancient Church in the four firſt General Councels: and therefore the lawful exerciſe of that power he had to adminiſter Sacraments or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Church, ceaſes upon ſuch diſcovery, or as I may ſay, <hi>Self-condemnation.</hi> We need not ſtand here to diſpute, when or how ſoon
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:114611:86"/>it ceaſes upon ſuch Hereſie: for we do not charge ſuch Hereſie upon thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> i.e. Hereſie immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly Fundamental, or thoſe main Hereſies declared againſt by the firſt General Councels; but then we muſt ſay, that many of their New Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Belief and Practiſe, are in themſelves Heretical, and as much or more, then were many Tenets of former Hereticks, declared againſt by the Ancient Church; whether we conſider the matter, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe <hi>Romiſh</hi> Articles, or the Obſtinacy and Tyranny with which they aſſerted and impoſed; ſo that, if there could be a full Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councel of the whole Catholic Church, they would undoubtedly be declared many of them Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</p>
               <p n="13">13. From whence it follows, that Hereſie thus lying upon them, might give us juſt cauſe to renounce their Errors, and quit their Communion ſo far, as it was neceſſitated by renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their Errors: though not juſt cauſe to condemn or renounce the Orders given by them or received from them.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:114611:86"/>
               <p>This may give anſwer to all the Places alleged by Doctor <hi>Champny</hi> (in his ninth cap. pag. 335, 336.) out of the Fathers, againſt Orders gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Hereticks; for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern either Hereticks in fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, or ſuch as were declared ſo, and actually ſeparated from the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church.</p>
               <p n="14">14. It is to be noted farther, that, when our firſt reformed Biſhops were ordained by them, the grand Hereſie and mother of their other Errors, as to the obſtinate an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical defending of them, I mean the Papal Power and Autority, was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured: and therefore their Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, however yet in <hi>Romiſh</hi> Errors could not be properly heretical, or peremptorily engaged to defend the ſame, as afterward they were: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> hath made them Errors eſtabliſhed, and ſworn to. But, after that, we went not to them for Orders, yet do acknowledg they have Ordination ſtill ſubſtantially valid, and therefore we do not re-ordain Prieſts that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from them to us, becauſe the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:114611:87"/>ſubſtance or Evangelical inſtitution is by thoſe words <hi>(Receive the holy Ghoſt, whoſe ſins ye remit,</hi> &amp;c.) retein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtill in the Roman Ordination, though clogged and depreſſed by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional corruptions; but cauſe them to renounce thoſe additionals and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Romiſh</hi> Errors.</p>
               <p>So then the ſumm of our firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, We do account them to be in Hereſie, and deeper then when we received Ordination from them; yet ſo, as not actually and wholly cut off from the Catholic Church, either by the nature of the Hereſie it ſelf caſting off from the foundation, or by declaration of the Catholic Church, caſting them out of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it: and therefore it doth not follow upon our accounting them Hereticks, that we could not lawfully receive Orders from them.</p>

<note place="margin">A ſupply of defect in Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on through Hereſie.</note> Our ſecond anſwer is from the ſupply of any defect in our Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion received from them: that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them Hereticks in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as made them forfeit their Union which the Catholic Church, and conſequently the due and lawful

And ſo the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> anſwer for the Biſhops, which they own, and yet were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by <hi>Cranmer</hi> in the time of the Schiſm, as they call it, ſaying: they recovered the lawful uſe by return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Schiſm and Hereſie in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, when they were reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> So if, upon our charging them with Hereſie, we muſt ſuppoſe they could not lawfully ordain, nor we lawfully receive Orders from them, then muſt it conformably be ſuppoſed, that we having depoſed their Hereſie and left their Communion, and by no other Hereſie forfeiting our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Catholic Church, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the due and lawful uſe of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and may lawfully adminiſter them to others, and now do it in the Unity of the Church.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>Champny</hi> did foreſee this might be anſwered by us, and therefore
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:114611:88"/>ſeeks to cut us off from this plea, by replying: <hi>That defect of lawful Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Vocation, which was in</hi> Cranmer <hi>by ſuppoſed Hereſie in his Ordainers, could not be ſupplyed, but by his reunion to the true Church and Paſtors thereof; but, beſides the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>there was no other Church or Lawful Paſtors, by recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to which, he could have that defect ſupplyed: Not other Reformed Churches, for they can leſs prove themſelves to be Churches, or to have Lawful Vocation of Paſtors, then the Church of</hi> England <hi>can: Not the</hi> Grecian, Ruſſian, <hi>or</hi> Ethiopic <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, for they alſo are in Schiſm and Hereſie, and our</hi> Engliſh <hi>Reformers pretend not to receive their calling from them, or to have it ſupplyed by them; therefore they can no wayes have their defect ſupplyed or recover the Lawful uſe of Ordination.</hi> So he, p. 337. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus having argued againſt our Vocation, upon our ſuppoſal of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie in thoſe we acknowledge our Ordainers, and boaſted of it as an indiſſoluble Argument, <hi>pag.</hi> 335. he
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:114611:88"/>is now fain to take away the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal it ſelf, by affirming them to be the only lawful Paſtors, and that none elſe in all the Chriſtian world could give lawful Ordination, or make a ſupply of what was wanting. The iſſue indeed of this point of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, either charged by us upon them, that gave Orders, or by them on us who received them, (which wil be his Argument below) comes to this, Whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be the only Church, in whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion the Unity of the Church is confined, and Ordination to be had, and therefore we and all other out of it, are in Schiſm and Hereſie, and can have no lawful Ordination? To this hold, after all the Velitation and light skirmiſhing upon our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, it was neceſſary he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire himſelf.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Now the ſtrength of this Hold ſtands but upon their unreaſonable phanſying of the whole Church, as of one ſociety in ſubjection to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Paſtor General, or Vicar of Chriſt, by which they judge of Hereſie and Schiſm, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:114611:89"/>admit none, as returning from it, but by actual reconciliation and ſubmiſſion to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time. What he ſayes of our not pretending to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our calling from other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<note place="margin">Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Hereticks.</note> or to have the defect of our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations ſupplyed by them, is true, but to no purpoſe; for the ſuppoſed defect in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Ordination (which we received) doth, as above ſaid, ceaſe upon our leaving off or quitting that, which is ſuppoſed to cauſe that defect in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. Nor was it needful, either for the ſupplying of any ſuch defect, or for the ſtating us in the Union of the Catholic Church, that we, being a National Church and independing on any forrein Juriſdiction, ſhould upon our diſagreement with <hi>Rome</hi> be bound to apply our ſelves to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches by actual reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or full agreement in what they held or practiſed. Of which in 16. <hi>Sect.</hi> of former book.</p>
               <p>For privat men indeed and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular companies of men returning from Hereſie or Schiſm, actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:114611:89"/>to the Church of which they were Members, or from which they departed is neceſſary: but not ſo for a National and independing Church. Such actual reconciliation, when it hath been performed, was but of the Solemnity of the buſineſs, and may be to good purpoſe done, when the whole body of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church ſtands entire in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fit to receive it, but the ſoul of Unity with the Church, is in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of Hereſie, and profeſſing the true Faith, and conſequently Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with all others that do it, not perhaps with a ful agreement in all things with us, yet with a charitable compliance, in not condemning us therefore, as no Church.</p>
               <p n="18">18. What he ſaith of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as the only true Church, to the concluding of all other Churches under Schiſm and Hereſie, is only ſaid, and not proved; being but the product of the forementioned Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that the whole Church of Chriſt is one ſociety bound together in ſubjection to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Head and general Paſtor, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:114611:90"/>therefore Hereticks and Schiſmaticks cannot be reſtored but by reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him. This he urges more properly (though to as little purpoſe) below, <hi>cap.</hi> 11. where he ſtrives to faſten Hereſie upon us, becauſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from that Church, and not yet reconciled to it: telling us, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Councels of <hi>Nice, Sardica,</hi> and others did ſo eſteem and conclude of Heretical Biſhops of the <hi>Arrians, Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Novatians,</hi> as no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops till received, and reconciled to the Church. It will be ſufficient in this place to ſay, I. That this comes not home to their purpoſe: for thoſe Councels did not appoint reconciliation to <hi>Rome,</hi> and for ſome time of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to that Church could not be good; when as <hi>Liberius</hi> the ejected Biſhop had ſubſcribed to that Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie for the recovering of his <hi>See,</hi> and <hi>Faelix</hi> that poſſeſſed it, was advanced by compliance with the <hi>Arrian</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which then prevailed every where. II. Although ſuch actual and ſolemn reconciliation of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church, with the Biſhops
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:114611:90"/>thereof, to the body of the Catholic Church, was fit to be performed, whileſt that body ſtood ſtil conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in good proportion, as it did in the beginning of the <hi>Arian</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, yet when once that Hereſie had overborn all, and almoſt all Biſhops with their flocks turned <hi>Arrian,</hi> in ſo much that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour told <hi>Liberius,</hi> (as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do uſually reproach us) that the <hi>whole world was againſt</hi> Athanaſius, and <hi>Liberius,</hi> as yet Catholic, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered for their paucity. <hi>Time was when three only ſtood for the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God againſt the King. Dan.</hi> 3. (as appears in 1. <hi>Tom. Concil.</hi>) when, I ſay, it was thus with the Church, how could ſuch actual and ſolemn reconciliation of any <hi>Arian</hi> Biſhops, or Nation, returning from Hereſie, be wel made? enough it was for ſuch to depoſe their Hereſie, and profeſs communion with all Chriſtians whereſoever that held the true faith. So was it enough for our Biſhops and this Nation to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Hereſie, and profeſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with all other Churches not
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:114611:91"/>guilty of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> errour, and not impoſing the belief or practice of that we differ in, as the condition of their Communion. And thus far in anſwer to his Inferences from our charging <hi>Antichriſtianiſme</hi> or <hi>Hereſie</hi> upon the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

<note place="margin">Form of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certain, how.</note> yet muſt grant that a certain form is required to every <hi>Order,</hi> and that ſuch a depravation, as they charge the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Ordination with, muſt needs ſo change the Form as to make all void and null; and ſo, by their own doctrine, they received no <hi>Order</hi> at all from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. This he endeavours to make good by the Form of Baptiſm, which if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved and changed [as to ſay, <hi>I Baptize thee in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who is greater then the Son,</hi> or the like] the Baptiſm is null. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, that unto lawful Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though not a Sacrament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, a lawful and certain form is required, ſuch as may expreſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Order, and the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and power of it, with application to the perſon receiving it.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:114611:95"/>which alſo is plain by the ſame Statute in theſe words, <hi>The effect whereof</hi> (viz. of thoſe Bulls and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments from <hi>Rome) hath been, and is, to abſolve and reconcile all thoſe, that wil be content to forſake their due Obedience to our Sovereign Lady, the Queen, and to yeild and ſubject themſelves to the uſurped Autority of the Biſhop of Rome.</hi> Is this Evangelical or Prieſtly reconciliation of Penitents to God?

The <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts then are juſtly ejected, puniſhed, whoſe abſolving of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents from ſin is proved a pretence of abſolving Subjects from their due o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; whoſe reconciling men to God or his Church, a cloak for their Reconciling to a forrein jurisdiction of Papal uſurped Autority; and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:114611:96"/>what that brings after it, who knows not?

<note place="margin">Of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> There remains one Argument more againſt our pleading Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from them, and that is drawn from our Doctrine about the <hi>Indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble character;</hi> which ſeeing we deny, we conſequently muſt hold, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no Order from them, no power to ordaine; it being not poſſible (ſaith he) to conceive how a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic declared, (in whom the deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

This is the ſumme of what he ſaith.
<note place="margin">Of Biga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, or Digamie.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We begin with that of Bigamie:
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:114611:102"/>of which M. <hi>Maſon</hi> took no notice in his defence of Biſhop <hi>Cranmers</hi> Ordination; and Doctor <hi>Champny</hi> only proves he was twice marryed, which is not denyed; but brings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to prove, that ſuch <hi>Bigamie,</hi> or <hi>Digamie</hi> rather, infers ſuch an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularitie, as deprives a Biſhop of the lawful uſe of his power of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining. To this charge it may be ſaid, I. That the <hi>Bigamy</hi> which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in his Canon, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. and implicitly forbids, when he ſaith, <hi>Let a Biſhop be the Husband of one Wife,</hi> was a ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a Second Wife upon the former, either kept ſtill or put away; a Polygamy both ways, either direct by cohabitation with two Wives, or that which followed upon unjuſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, and was indeed the having of two Wives at once, a licentious Cuſtome frequent among Jews and Gentiles. Now ſuch a perſon that had done ſo, before his Converſion to Chriſtianity or after, was juſtly debarred by the Apoſtle from Holy Orders, but of this <hi>Cranmer</hi> was not guilty. As for that <hi>Digamy,</hi> which
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:114611:102"/>is the taking of a ſecond Wife after the firſt being dead; or the taking of a Widow to wife at firſt, we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it forbidden by ſome Canons of the Church, &amp; that for the moſt part the former place of the Apoſtle was by the Ancients applyed to this <hi>Diga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;</hi> for no marvel if being earneſt in the commendation of ſingle life, they ſhould ſo readily receive the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles words in that ſenſe which moſt anſwered to their purpoſe. But ſome of the Ancients better conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, do acknowledg the meaning of the Apoſtle to be according to the former interpretation: amongſt whom are reckoned <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Chryſoſtome,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret.</hi> Yea that parallel place, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.9. of <hi>a Widow, having been the Wife of one Man,</hi> doth moſt reaſonably receive the like interpretation: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> cry out of it as a thing unheard of, that a Woman ſhould have two Husbands at once; which is true of two by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation, not by deſertion; for ſo it was often ſeen that the Woman either forſaking her Husband or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken

               <p n="2">2. II. Therefore we may ſay, That <hi>Digamy</hi> forbidden by Eccleſ. Canon, and found in <hi>Cranmer,</hi> doth not make a Biſhop ſo far irregular, as to ſpoil him of the lawful uſe of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:114611:103"/>This reſts upon the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the purpoſe and binding force of ſuch Canons.

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be thought of ſome of them, this ſeems plainly crept into that number (if we conſider the liberty of thoſe firſter Ages in this point of Marriage) from after-Times, and ſo of no other Autority, then are after-Eccleſiaſtical Canons. But let that be what it will for the preſent, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtands bound to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Autority of them, as wel as we, and hath tranſgreſſed againſt them, eſpecially the ſixt Canon, in a matter forbidden not only by theſe Canons, but by the Law of God, and the Judgment of the Apoſtle indeed: and that is the putting away of Wife, or forcing a Man to put her away, in pretence of Religion, or holy Orders. As for Canons Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, they deſerve to have their due reſpect and obedience, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Autority</hi> by which made,

If we look into the conſtitutions of <hi>Otho</hi> the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat in <hi>England,</hi> which are as ſevere againſt Concubines as any they have, yet ſee much difference in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt the Concubinary and the Married Clergy, The conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the Married runs, <hi>Si clam vel palam Matrimonium contraxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint, omnino ſunt amovendi, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Marriage ſecretly or openly, they are by all means to be removed,</hi> that's peremptory, and though the Marriage be ſecretly carried; but the Conſtitution againſt the Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binary, <hi>ſi publicè Concubinas detinent, if they keep Concubines publickly,</hi> they are to be admoniſht, and after a Month to put them away, or els to be ſuſpended—And in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or gloſs upon it, <hi>ob ſimplicem Fornicationem de Canonicâ benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Clericus non debet deponi, licèt ſecùs fortè de Canonis rigore; for ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

As for Penances, which their Canons adjudge Concubinaries to, who knows not how eaſily that may be ſatisfied, and in extremity it is no other cenſure then a Lay-man incurs upon the like offence, doth not imply or carry with it Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſuch an irregularity, as they charge upon Marriage or Digamy. Nor will it boot to ſay (as they will be ready to reply) that if the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Clergy put away their Wives, they are not depoſed, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly it is required of Concubina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that they put away their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines; for as Marriage and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication ſtand not upon equal terms in themſelves, the firſt being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble Conjunction, ſo neither are they with equal ſeverity enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Romaniſts, as appears by their practice, hinted in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes.</p>

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:114611:107"/>willingly received; as is apparent in the paſſages of Hiſtory, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church, in which thoſe Canons were violently proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. After-ages ſtill found leſs cauſe to receive, or continue them, where received: and now long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of many and great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences and miſchiefs by the exacting of them, perſwades and enforces the reſtoring of the Clergy to that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Marriage,</hi> which is left them by the Law of God, yea to the uſe of that Remedy, which is preſcribed them by that Law, when need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it.</p>
               <p>If we look into the Hiſtory of this Church and Kingdom, we find that before the times of <hi>Lanfrank</hi> and <hi>Anſelm,</hi> the Clergy were free, and enjoyed the liberty of Marriage; but when they were compelled by thoſe hot <hi>Italians</hi> to forgo that freedome, what ſucceſs had it, but the begetting of a licentious unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even unto <hi>Sodomy?</hi> which in few years grew ſo notorious, that the ſame <hi>Anſelm</hi> who by Synod in <hi>London</hi> had ſeverely forbidden Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,

<note place="margin">Proteſtant Doctrine not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by a lawful Councel.</note> His ſecond Argument drawn into form ſtands thus. <hi>That Doctrine which was condemned as Heretical by due Autority, and due form of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Heretical; but the Doctrine which</hi> Cranmer <hi>after his departure</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> profeſſed, was ſo—That it was ſo condemned by due Autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he thus endeavours to prove. <hi>That which was condemned by the ſame Autority and judgment, by which the</hi> Arrian <hi>and other Hereſies were in the General Councels of the Church is condemned by due Autority: But the Proteſtant Doctrine, which</hi> Cranmer <hi>and the reſt embraced, was ſo condemned, viz. by the Councell of</hi> Trent; <hi>againſt which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be objected by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, which might not as well been ſaid againſt the</hi> Nicene; <hi>Nothing be ſaid by them for their doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned at</hi> Trent, <hi>which might not as well by the</hi> Arrians, <hi>for their Hereſie

               <p>Anſw. to the Proſyllogiſme; If by <hi>due Autority and form of Judgment,</hi> be meant not only lawful Autority, but Autority alſo lawfully and duly uſed, (that is, that in ſuch Councels the judgment be paſſed or given by thoſe that have Autority, and do uſe it accordingly, giving their Judgment, according to the rule of Gods Word, which is the Chief Autority in ſuch Judgments) then we grant, that whatever is ſo condemned of Hereſie to be Heretical, but deny the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Doctrine to be ever ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. And therefore we ſay, the Aſſumption or ſecond propoſition in the ſecond Syllogiſme is falſe, For the Proteſtant Doctrine was not condemned at all in <hi>Trent</hi> Councel, when <hi>Cranmer</hi> forſook the <hi>Romiſh</hi> error, which was before any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel held at <hi>Trent:</hi> Nor yet ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned there (when that Councel was held) as the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie was in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel.</p>

Did they ſet the Holy Scriptures in the midſt before them to judg by at <hi>Trent,</hi> as they did at <hi>Nice?</hi> Did they not ſet up unwritten Traditions in equal Autority with Scriptures, and are not moſt of their Decrees grounded only upon ſuch Tradition? Did they at <hi>Nice</hi> receive their Determinations from the Popes Conſiſtory, as at <hi>Trent</hi> by weekly Curriers?

               </p>
               <p>This and much more we can ſay againſt that Councel, wherefore it ſhould not have the like Autority

So that we may juſtly retort his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus: That Doctrine which was condemned by no better Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then was the Catholic Doctrine in the <hi>Syrmian</hi> Councel by the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> or in the ſecond of <hi>Epheſus</hi> by the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> cannot be therefore Heretical; but the Proteſtant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was condemned by no better Autority in <hi>Trent</hi>—for what can they object againſt thoſe factious Councels, but may as well againſt that of <hi>Trent?</hi> Or what can they ſay for their Doctrine (I mean the main points of direct Popery) but thoſe Hereticks might for theirs? Saying, that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrines are not ſo immediatly againſt the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and may plead a longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, then the other could; which yet is no preſcription againſt Truth, that was before them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, by <hi>Champnyes</hi> Argument, ſo far as it applyed to the Church of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:114611:111"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> may be concluded, that our Saviour and his Doctrine was as rightly condemned, as <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile</hi> or any falſe Prophet, that went before him; for he was condemned by the ſame Autority of the great Councel or Conſiſtory, by which that <hi>Judas</hi> and other falſe Prophets were before condemned. Let <hi>Champ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> or any other <hi>Romaniſt</hi> anſwer this (which muſt be by requiring (as above ſaid) not only the ſame Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but alſo the lawful uſe of it, according to the Rule they are to judg by) and he may have an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the like Argument, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in behalf of the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> Sentence and Judgment againſt Proteſtants, and Proteſtant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>

                  <hi>But</hi> Cranmer <hi>and the reſt that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, went out of the Church, in which they were Baptized, and cannot ſhew that Church to have gone out of a more antient one</hi>—</p>

               <p n="12">12. For a Church to go out of it ſelf, and return to it ſelf, needs not ſeem any ſtrange thing or phraſe:

For his Argument from the Autority condemning our Doctrine, it was retorted upon them when we anſwered it: For that of our going out from that Church, it was ſhewn how it concerns them, who keeping the ſame Place and Seat, yet going out of the Doctrine of the Ancient Church are thereby concluded Heretical.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:114611:122"/>the Fathers, but that divers Opinions may ariſe about them, and be defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with probability.</hi> This whether true or falſe doth not greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us. But ſee we, how he will make it concern us. His Inference from it is this: <hi>Therefore we muſt truſt the Tradition of the Church</hi> (he meanes the preſent Church of <hi>Rome) for the whole Matter and Form; and becauſe we know not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in or by which Words or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Sacrament is eſſentially per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, therefore we muſt not omit any of thoſe words, things, or actions, which the Church uſes, and in the whole comprehenſion of which, their Authors all agree the whole Matter and Form of that Sacrament to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,</hi> pag. 413, 414.</p>
               <p>But firſt, This doth not prove, that our Ordinations are certainly null and invalid, (as he pretended) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we omit ſome things and Words which they uſe, (for they are not agreed, whether it eſſentially conſiſts in thoſe we uſe, or in thoſe we omit) but only concludes, we cannot (in their judgment) be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:114611:122"/>that our Ordinations are ful and perfect; For having acknowledged, that <hi>Vaſques</hi> with others hold the immediat <hi>Matter</hi> of Ordination to be Impoſition of Hands, and the Form to be in thoſe Words, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt</hi> (which is to confeſs the Subſtance or Eſſence, and ſo the Validity of Ordination to conſiſt in that which we retein and uſe) he makes but a Scholaſtick diſpute of it, the iſſue whereof is, that <hi>Vaſques</hi> his opinion can but amount to a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and therefore we are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly but probably ordained, <hi>pag.</hi> 423. &amp;c. Let it be ſo in his opinion, (which yet comes ſhort of a <hi>certainly Null</hi>) it is enough for us that we certainly know, that our way of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is according to, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable by Scripture, and can give reaſon (as a little below) why we omit many things that they uſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Secondly, Seeing the Inference he made, and the reſolution he gave concerning their compounded Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, comes but to a <hi>juncta juvant,</hi> ſuch as the advice of a friend to uſe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:114611:123"/>all the ingredients of a <hi>Recipe</hi> not being able to tell, which giveth force to the Medicine: we may ſpare ſurely ſome of their Mixtures, when we have better directions to tell us they are ſuperfluous, and noxious to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they are uſed for. But we would adviſe them to follow this reſolution or adviſe in uſing the whole <hi>Matter</hi> of the undoubted Sacrament of the Euchariſt:
<note place="margin">Scrupulous in Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials, careles and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials.</note> and not think it enough to conſecrate it in Bread and Wine, but alſo to diſtribute it (which is the purpoſe of the Sacrament) in both kinds to the Communicants. Dare they ſay of this Sacrament it is not certain, that our Saviour did appoint it in the determinate <hi>Matter</hi> of Bread and Wine? If they durſt, yet were it wiſdome, according to <hi>Champny</hi>'s former reſolution and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe in point of Ordinations, not to omit either part, which our Saviour hath appointed, and the Ancient Church conſtantly adminiſtred to the People.</p>

<note place="margin">Of their Vnction in Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Now for our omiſſion of their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> (which is the main of thoſe Ceremonies we uſe not) we ſay, they
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:114611:123"/>cannot prove it Apoſtolical, or that it was uſed in Ordination by the <hi>Greek</hi> Church. But admit it was uſed anciently in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church, we ſay it was but a tolerable or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Rite or Ceremony, as were many other anciently uſed, but not now ſeen in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And reaſon there was, wherefore we ſhould not continue ſome ancient Ceremonies after the infection of Popiſh corruptions: as in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; They had made <hi>Order</hi> a Sacrament, and annexed to this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of Unction a Sacramental vertue. We dare not be ſo bold; and, certainly, the Church ought to be very wary and ſparing in Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to be uſed in and about any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
               <p>In Sacraments we are to look at that which is ſignified, or conferred;
<note place="margin">Of ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</note> Grace, which is the ſole act of God, is the thing conferred, and alſo ſignified; but there is and may be alſo a ſignification of the Duty of Man, who receives the Sacrament. Now Ceremonies added, do either ſignifie the Duty of man receiving,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:114611:124"/>and theſe are the moſt innocent, and to this ſort may refer the ſigne of the Croſs in Baptiſm; which was uſed not to give any vertue any way, but to ſignifie the duty of the baptized <hi>(not to be aſhamed of Chriſt crucified, but manfully to fight under his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)</hi> and to mind him of it. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſort are ſuch, as ſignifie Gods act in the Sacrament, his imparting of Grace; and to this purpoſe, it is like they that firſt uſed <hi>Chriſm</hi> in Baptiſm and ſo in Ordination meant it, to ſignifie (not confer) that <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſma Spiritus,</hi> of which the Fathers often: This ſort comes very neer to intrenching upon Gods inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who appoints his Sacramental Symbols to <hi>ſignifie</hi> his grace, as alſo to <hi>confer</hi> it; Laſtly therefore, when Ceremonies are added by man, not only to ſignifie, but with a kind of Sacramental vertue to confer or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the grace or work of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, it is high preſumption. And to this ſort perteins the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which makes the moſt of them ſo earneſtly contend to have it the very <hi>Matter</hi> of their Sacrament of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:114611:124"/>Order, and made us in the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Popiſh abuſes, to leave it off: and we reteined the ſign of the Croſs in Baptiſm, though abuſed in ſome meaſure by Popiſh Superſtition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the native importance of it is the innocent and uſeful ſignification (as I ſaid) of duty in the party bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: the like whereof cannot be ſaid of <hi>

There are but two things can be ſaid; either that our Baptiſm is not valid and good, which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he dare not ſay: or that there is not the like reaſon of Baptiſm and Ordination, which he cannot ſay, as to this point; For though he may put a difference between them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of validity that depends upon the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> who in Ordination is preciſely determined, yet in regard
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:114611:125"/>of Validity by reaſon of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> (which is the preſent conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration) he muſt ſay that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> are both alike; for to him as One is a Sacrament, ſo is the Other, and from the One he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times argues to prove the like in the Other; as from the <hi>Form</hi> of Baptiſm, to the <hi>Form</hi> of Ordination, as we ſaw above, in his 10. chap. and may below in his 14. pag. 480. which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes for better clearing this buſineſs of the <hi>Form</hi> of Ordination, we will here inſert.</p>
               <p n="9">9. There he thus argues. <hi>Quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admodum ſi aliâ formâ &amp; ritu,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Even as if</hi> Parker (for there he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes againſt his Ordination from the <hi>Form</hi> of it) <hi>had been baptized after any other form or manner then</hi> Auguſtine <hi>delivered, he had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived true Baptiſm: ſo neither true Ordination,</hi> being ordeined by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Form, then <hi>Auſtin was ordeined and did ordein by.</hi>— And pag. 483. he thus again argues againſt our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, that we retein in our <hi>Form</hi> of Ordination what is eſſential, and according to Scripture, <hi>Si nihil aliud
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:114611:125"/>ad eſſentiam,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If nothing elſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein to the Eſſence of Baptiſm or Holy Order, but what is expreſſed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, then the Form both of Baptiſm and Ordination uſed in the Church of</hi> England <hi>is to be rejected, becauſe no where expreſſed in Scripture.</hi> How falſe this <hi>(no where expreſſed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture)</hi> is of the Form of Baptiſm I noted above, under his firſt propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and how the Form of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in Scripture either expreſly conteined, or deducible and approve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by it, was alſo there declared. But by both theſe reaſonings it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that to him <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> are of like conſideration, and therefore I would require a Reaſon, why they pronounce not our Baptiſm null, becauſe not after their manner, as well as our Orders. A man would think that <hi>Champny</hi> in both theſe reaſonings did imply we had not true Baptiſm, but durſt not ſay it poſitively; for that had directly contradicted the practice of their Church, which doth not re-baptize thoſe, that are baptized after our Form; yea, the doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:114611:126"/>of the Catholic Church, which required no more to the Eſſentiall Form, then what is expreſly in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Baptize in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and therefore did not re-baptize Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks that uſed the Form. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for us (notwithſtanding any thing that <hi>Champny</hi> hath ſaid) to <hi>Baptize</hi> as our Saviour appointed, and to <hi>Ordein,</hi> as we find the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles (whom <hi>he ſent, as his Father had ſent him</hi>) to have done and taught, though not altogether <hi>Ritu Romano,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, and teaches moſt imperiouſly.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But we muſt here take leave to look back to that he ſaid above of <hi>Parker</hi> being not ordeined as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi> (the firſt Arch-Biſhop) was, which, if taken with the occaſion of it, may at firſt ſight appear a ſeeming prejudice. The occaſion of it was from Mr. <hi>Maſons</hi> ſaying, <hi>That</hi> Mat.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:114611:126"/>
                  <hi>Champny</hi> to the ſeeming diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Reformation infers, <hi>Therefore his Ordination</hi> (and ſo theirs that followed him) <hi>cannot be derived from the Apoſtles if not the ſame, that</hi> Auſtin <hi>delivered together with the Chriſtian Faith to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, above a thouſand years ago</hi>— and <hi>as well,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they may caſt off Baptiſm, which the ſame</hi> Auſtin <hi>delivered,</hi> &amp;c. p. 479, 480.</p>
               <p>But we may anſwer, That the Popes Bul, and Pall, and other ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities which <hi>Maſon</hi> reflected on, were of later date, then <hi>Auſtins</hi> time; for long it was after that, ere the Popes Bulls and wild Beaſts roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red within this Land, <hi>viz.</hi> after <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the 7. for then began the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention with Princes about inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Biſhops; from which time thoſe Bulls alſo began to rage, and did very much trouble this Land in that one particular of appointing the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> in which regard we may well ſay with Mr. <hi>Maſon,</hi> it was a happineſs to <hi>Mathew Parker</hi> to be the firſt that was conſecrated without the Popes
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:114611:127"/>Bull, not implying that all from <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> were ſo inveſted by the Pope, but of all in that number, who were conſecrated after that uſurped Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal inveſtiture began, he was the firſt that was clearly without it.</p>
               <p n="11">11. As for that which <hi>Auſtin</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, (either Baptiſm or Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) we retein fully for ſubſtance, and do thankfully acknowledg the benefit; indeed ſome Ceremonies (as in that Age the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> began to abound in them) which he brought in and delivered in both, we happily omit to uſe, not becauſe he delivered or uſed them, but becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſince abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, as above ſaid. This ſhews the vanity of <hi>Champny's</hi> inference, that our Baptiſm and Ordination is not good, or derived from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, becauſe not after the ſame form and manner (peradventure accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſome additional Ceremonies) that <hi>Auſtin</hi> delivered to this Nation together with the Chriſtian Faith. Yea by vertue of that Ordination received, which he delivered to us, we can better prove our Ordination
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:114611:127"/>Apoſtolical, then they can theirs; for the Succeſſion of Lawful <hi>Romiſh</hi> Biſhops was much broken by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful intruſion of many Popes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the 9. and 10. Ages, and after (as appeared above, when we ſpoke of Papal Antichriſtianiſm) whereas our ſucceſſion of Biſhops being by <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt derived to us from the Apoſtles, (before that unlawful uſurpation, and intruſion of many of their Popes together) hath been continued among us without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>

I ſhould abuſe the Reader too much to repeat and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:114611:128"/>anſwer them all; blowing therefore away the lighteſt, I ſhall ſpeak to thoſe, that may ſeem to carry any ſhew of probability.</p>
               <p>And firſt, he will prove it, ſuch is the ſtrength of his preſumption, by the Judgment of Proteſtants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Ridley,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>at the ſtake humbly begged, the Queen would be pleaſed to confirm the Leaſes, he had letten as Biſhop of</hi> London, <hi>therefore he held himſelf not Lawful Biſhop.</hi> True: it was his humble ſupplication to the Lord <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Thame,</hi> that he would be a means to the Queen to do it; and this was a <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of his charity, and conſcionable reſpect to the Tenants, not of his thinking himſelf not lawful Biſhop; he knew what they thought and judged of him, not only that no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, but alſo no Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> becauſe of <hi>Boner</hi> then living, and thereupon would be ready to quarrel at thoſe Leaſes demiſed by him. And ſo the Words which <hi>Champny</hi> cites out of <hi>Brook</hi> his reports, do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein the Sentence of judgment in this caſe, but the plea that was pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:114611:128"/>againſt ſuch Leaſes, <hi>becauſe the Biſhops that let them, were not Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. His next Demonſtration,
<note place="margin">Boners plea.</note> or Preſumption is drawn from a ſtory of <hi>Boner</hi> the ejected Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> who for refuſing the Oath of Supremacy tendred to him by <hi>Horn</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> was cited into the Kings Bench, and anſwered, that he refuſed the Oath, becauſe he that tender'd it, had no power to do it, being no Biſhop. The Judges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon conſulted, whether they ſhould admit <hi>Boner</hi> to traverſe it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, he ought to have leave to do it, and to be acquitted the Court, if he could prove <hi>Horn</hi> to be no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop then. This out of <hi>Dier;</hi> But, ſaith he, <hi>Boner</hi> was never after call'd to plead it; whence he concludes they judged <hi>Horn</hi> to be indeed no Biſhop. Anſwer, This is no <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi> of the invalidity of his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but of the Moderation and juſtice of thoſe Judges, that contein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves within the compaſs of their own profeſſion, not underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to determin whether the Form
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:114611:129"/>of Ordination was good or no; and of their equity in allowing <hi>Boner</hi> the liberty of his plea, how falſe ſoever his allegation was in it ſelfe: and it was an argument of their prudence, or of the Queens wiſdome, that held it more convenient to ſilence ſuch a Bedlam Actor, then ſuffer him to come upon the Stage, who had more then once in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time ſo irreverently behaved himſelf with clamors and reproaches before the Kings Commiſſioners. But this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he had of his many miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, that he was confined to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual impriſonment, whereas his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Biſhops, that denyed the Oath, as well as he, enjoyed their Liberty, or els a pleaſing and free Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſome Friends houſe.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The former preſumption he enforces from the ſtatute of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament the year following, which provided indemnity for all that had refuſed the Oath tender'd by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop or Biſhop till that time, <hi>Anno</hi> 8. <hi>Eli.</hi> cap. 1. <hi>Which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>evidently proves</hi> Boners <hi>plea to be good, that they were not Biſhops indeed and that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:114611:129"/>the Parliament ſo judged of them.</hi> This is ſtill the fallacy, <hi>à non cauſâ;</hi> for the cauſe or reaſon of this was not becauſe the Parliament, of which the Biſhops themſelves were a good part, doubted of their lawful Ordination (for how could that be after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years practice of it, as had run in King <hi>Edwards</hi> and this Queens reigne?) but becauſe they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the doubtings, which others had of it. For conſidering the condition of the Kingdom, ſome years before turned from Popery, they had reaſon to think (and ſo they had found it by the reproaches of ſome, and the ſurmiſes of others, as they plainly ſignifie in that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute) that many were not ſatisfied concerning the Canonical and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ordination of our Biſhops and Prieſts, meaſuring it by the way of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and as they had ſeen it performed in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes: or thinking it not provided for by the Law of this Land ſince Queen <hi>Maries</hi> repeal; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parliament in reſpect to ſuch as offended upon ſuch ſcruple, decreed

                  <hi>But ſuch a ful dispenſation</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>had been needleſs, had there been no defects of moment indeed;</hi> For no prudent Prince wil <hi>ſpend his Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in diſpenſing aforehand with ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary and poſsible defects.</hi>— Such it ſeems was the importunity of Popiſh ſlanderers, that the Queen in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thought beſt to take away the occaſion, by taking away the ground on which any ſuſpition might be vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſuppoſed force of any ſuch pretended Canon, that might

Thus <hi>Champny</hi> trifles again and again with his furmiſes and ſeeming probabilities of real and eſſential defect in the Ordination of our Biſhops; I will not trouble the ingenuous Reader any farther with them. Only one thing I muſt take notice of, which he ſpeaks poſitively, <hi>That the Queen had no power to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe in rebus Eccleſiaſticis,</hi> and after ſets it on thus: <hi>She had no more power to diſpenſe in ſuch things, then her Subjects had to diſpenſe with her Laws,</hi> pag. 451.455. And there he requires <hi>One approved example for</hi> 1500. <hi>years,</hi> to juſtifie ſuch a power. Though we extend not this power to all <hi>Eccleſiaſtical things</hi> or <hi>Canons,</hi> yet ſay we truly that a Soveraign Prince hath power to diſpenſe in and about Eccleſiaſtical things: yea, hath power to forbid the Popes Law to be received or obeyed within his Dominions. If <hi>Champny,</hi> as he ſhews himſelf in the next <hi>Chap.</hi> to be well acquainted with <hi>Tortus</hi> or <hi>Bellarm.</hi> ſo had looked into the Anſwer to <hi>Tortus,</hi> he might have ſeen examples
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:114611:133"/>brought there by B. <hi>Andrews</hi> of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels ſubmitting their decrees to the Emperors Autority, that he would be pleaſed, <hi>ea corrigere, ſupplere, perficere;</hi> to correct or ſupply them. Now what power the Emp. had <hi>in Orbe Romano,</hi> that every Soveraign Prince hath in his own Dominions. But <hi>Champny,</hi> me thinks, ſhould not be ſuch a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in <hi>France</hi> as not to hear, or ſo forgetful, as not to remember, how many years the King kept out the decrees of the <hi>Trent</hi> Councel; and when the Clergy by the mouth of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Tours</hi> petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the King 1598. to admit them, they did it with reſtriction and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of them. to the privileges and Laws of the Land; and what did that want of a diſpenſation? It need not therefore ſeem ſtrange that the Qu. ſhould uſe her power in diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing againſt any Papal Canon, that (however hitherto obteining) ſhould any way contrary the Laws eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed concerning Ordinations.</p>
               <p n="18">18.
<note place="margin">Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the racords weak.</note> One Argument more he adds upon the ſtrength of preſumption, not only againſt the Validity of the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:114611:133"/>Form of Ordination, but againſt the Truth of the Tables or Records, that witneſs the Ordination of our Biſhops. This preſumption he raiſes chiefly upon Biſhop <hi>Jewels</hi> ſilence in anſwering of <hi>Harding,</hi> when he put him to it, to make good his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. Of this from pag. 457. to the end of his 13. <hi>Chap. Harding</hi> in his firſt reply had told the Biſhop, that he was neither Biſhop nor Prieſt, &amp; put divers interrogatories to him concerning his Ordination. The Biſhop briefly anſwered his imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Adverſary as he ſaw fitting; <hi>Harding</hi> replyes again with the like or greater importunity; and becauſe the Biſhop did not enter here a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute with him and ſatisfie all his que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions in particular, and withall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Records; therefore <hi>Champ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> according to his wonted preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concludes the Ordination of our Biſhops could not be maintained, and the Records were juſtly ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for who could better defend the lawfulneſs of their Ordination, or better know thoſe Records (if any ſuch had been) then <hi>Jewel,</hi> who
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:114611:134"/>was one of thoſe pretended Biſhops? To this purpoſe he.</p>
               <p>There is a time when, as the wiſe man tells us, ſome men are not to be anſwered in their folly. Half of M. <hi>Hardings</hi> importunity came to this, why <hi>Jewel</hi> being no Prieſt med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Holy things? and how could he be a Prieſt that could not offer Sacrifice? This the Biſhop well knew to be fully anſwered, in diſproving their Sacrifice of the Maſs; which he largely and ſolidly did: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently evinced that we may be Prieſts in the Goſpel ſenſe, without taking to our ſelves ſuch a power, and that they are no Prieſts indeed, but Sacrilegious Impoſtors in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to themſelves ſuch a power. The reſt of M. <hi>Hardings</hi> importunity que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned his being Biſhop; and becauſe he enters not a diſpute about the <hi>Form</hi> by which he was conſecrated, why ſhould <hi>Champny</hi> conclude he could not defend it, when as <hi>Harding</hi> ſaid not ſo much againſt it, as <hi>Champny</hi> himſelf hath done to invalidate it? and what that was we heard above, and found it too
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:114611:134"/>weak to diſprove this our Aſſertion, <hi>That the form we reteined doth contein all that eſſentially belongs to Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that which we caſt out, was either ſuperfluous addition, or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious abuſe.</hi> Laſtly, as for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Records to juſtifie his conſecration, he knew it was to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe, having to deal with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Harding,</hi> who had often in this Reply call'd him a <hi>Forger</hi> and <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> and would certainly have accounted him ſo in producing the Records.</p>
               <p n="19">19. But he tells us farther; <hi>Not only Maſter</hi> Harding, <hi>but many other Engliſh Catholicks, objected to thoſe pretended Biſhops, the defect of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful calling and Ordination, and yet were not the Records produced by any of them, nor by any other in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, till</hi> Maſon <hi>now after</hi> 50. <hi>years gave us a view of them;</hi> So he, <hi>p.</hi> 47<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:114611:135"/>of which, the producing of the Records had not been proper. But <hi>Champny,</hi> as he brought <hi>Rainolds</hi> objecting, ſo he might have met with <hi>Rainolds</hi> anſwering as to that point, if he had thought fit to take notice of that which <hi>Maſon</hi> in the concluſion of his third book relates, from Doctor <hi>Rainolds</hi> himſelf, who told him, that in his conference with <hi>Hart, he ſatisfied him concerning our Biſhops by Authentick Records, in ſo much that</hi> Hart <hi>would needs have that whole point</hi> (viz. touching the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our Biſhops) <hi>left out of the Conference, confeſsing he thought no ſuch thing could be ſhown, and that he had been born in hand otherwiſe.

                  </note> That <hi>Barlo</hi> one of the Ordainers was never, as it appears, conſecrated himſelf; for <hi>Maſon</hi> could not give us the Record of his Conſecration as of the reſt.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:114611:138"/>ſo demiſed by him, therefore he was a Lawful Husband, and Father; ſo it follows evidently that <hi>Barlo</hi> being without queſtion admitted to that public Action, was a Lawful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Biſhop: Whereas <hi>Champ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> Negative Argument againſt him runs thus weakly, according to the former inſtance, ſuch a Mans Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age cannot be found in the Regiſter of the Pariſh Church, therefore he is no Lawful Husband. But <hi>Godwin</hi> a diligent ſearcher of the Regiſters of Biſhops, finds him conſecrated Biſhop of <hi>Aſaph,</hi> Feb. 22. 1535. and the next year tranſlated to S. <hi>Davids</hi> where he ſate ten years in King <hi>Henry's</hi> reign, beſides the time of King <hi>Edward.</hi> Now what reaſon can be imaginable, why he ſhould continue Biſhop, doing all the Offices and duties of a Biſhop, ſo long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſecration, or that he ſhould be ſuffered ſo to do?</p>
               <p>Furthermore, that he may ſay ſomething rather then nothing, he obſerves, <hi>pag.</hi> 494. that <hi>Landaff,</hi> who was conſecrated ſome years after <hi>Barlo,</hi> is pretended to be ſet before

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they ſhould make choice of ſuch a place, a Tavern for ſo ſacred an Action, which would ſhew them to be Madmen, and fitter for <hi>Bedlam,</hi> then Biſhopricks, when as Churches and Chappels were open to them, as <hi>Maſon</hi> noted <hi>Champny</hi> pretends, <hi>they knew</hi> Landaff <hi>would not be brought to their Churches;</hi> Very like, when he notwithſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> all his life time after, and held his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick to his death: but if he ſcrupled to come into our Churches, why ſhould they think he would meet them at a Tavern? or why make choice of a Tavern rather then ſome other privat, though common place? The queſtion then is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Landaff</hi> was ſo good a fellow to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:114611:140"/>approve of a meeting there? or whether <hi>Champney</hi> was in Wine, when he wrote this? or the Reader will be ſuch a Fool as to believe it? As for <hi>Parker, Grindal,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who are thus defamed, their lives and manner of Converſation before and after, did ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to all men, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Learned, Grave, Sober, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat. Laſtly, let me obſerve, how this ſtory betrays it ſelf in the ſtrange Form of their Ordination, and muſt either conclude thoſe grave Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be Madmen again, that having the Form of Ordination uſed in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, and commanded by the Law, would or durſt uſe any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially ſo ridiculous one, as is here reported: or els condemn the raiſers of this report, of ſenſleſs impudency, and the believers of it, of notorious folly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But we are yet again call'd back to anſwer a Negative argument from <hi>John Stow,</hi> who hath omitted to ſpeak any thing of the conſecration of this Archbiſhop. And why ſhould that be ſo ſtrange? Becauſe <hi>Stow
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:114611:141"/>doth not uſually admit any memorable thing done at</hi> London, <hi>and all Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niclers uſe to be very diligent in Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all Innovations in States—and this</hi> Stow <hi>was punctual in deſcribing the reception, conſecration and enſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> Card. Pool, <hi>which yet was but after the wonted manner; it is then very ſtrange he ſhould ſay nothing of the Conſecrating of this new Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop after the New Faſhion; not ſeen in</hi> England <hi>before; and the more ſtrange this, becauſe</hi> Stow <hi>is known to have born great reſpect to</hi> Mat. Parker. <hi>There muſt needs be other cauſe of ſuch wilful ſilence, beſides forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> to this purpoſe he, <hi>pag.</hi> 503, &amp;c. As for <hi>Card. Pools</hi> reception, and conſecration, <hi>Stow</hi> doth not <hi>fuse deſcribere, deſcribe it at large,</hi> as <hi>Champny</hi> ſayes, but only mentions it as done; and conſidering that Chroniclers uſe to be punctual in deſcribing all the <hi>Pageants</hi> that are ſhewn at the entrance or entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Princes, I marvel he did not enlarge himſelf in relating the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how this great Cardinal (ſuch a ſpecial perſon, comming upon ſuch a
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:114611:141"/>ſpecial errand, with Legatine power to reconcile and bring back the whole Kingdome to the Chu. of <hi>Rome</hi>) was received, conſecrated and enſtalled, which no queſtion was ſet off with all the holy <hi>Pageantry</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> pomp. Whereas the Conſecration of Proteſtant Biſhops, being now more ſimply and homely (though more Apoſtolical) with few, but innocent Ceremonies, did not afford matter ſo much for a Chronicle, as a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. One thing more was ſpecial in the Cardinals entrance, which <hi>Stow</hi> notes: <hi>The ſame day</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that Docter Cranmer</hi> (his predeceſſour) <hi>was burnt, the Cardinal ſang his firſt Maſs.</hi> A good beginning! One was burning, the other ſinging.</p>
               <p>But what if <hi>Stow</hi> profeſſed ſo much reſpect to Archbiſhop <hi>Parker?</hi> was this the only kindneſs he could do his friend, to tell the Kingdom what it knew, that he was Archbiſhop? That reſpect and honour he bore the Archbiſhop, if he had meant to ſhew it, would have rather invited him to be copious in ſetting out his perſonal vertues and endowments, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:114611:142"/>he hath not once mentioned, why ſhould we marvell at his ſilence in the other? And could there be done any thing at <hi>London,</hi> more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable, and of more concernment in the way of the Church, (or a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter innovation in <hi>Champney's</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) then the firſt Synod held in the Queens reign, where Uniformity of Doctrine and Religion drawn up in 39.

<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of Biſhop <hi>Scory</hi> and <hi>Coverdale.</hi>
                  </note> Next he endeavours to prove that <hi>Scory</hi> and <hi>Coverdale</hi> two other Ordainers of <hi>Parker,</hi> were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated themſelves, either after the old <hi>Roman</hi> or new <hi>Engliſh</hi> way, and thinks he convinces it evidently, thus. The <hi>Ordinals</hi> (ſaith he) or old way of conſecration, were aboliſhed by the Parliament, of 2. and 3. of King <hi>Edward;</hi> The new <hi>Form,</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the Parliament of the 5. and 6. of the ſame King; but the two former Ordainers were conſecrated
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:114611:142"/>according to <hi>Maſons</hi> records, <hi>Aug.</hi> 30. 1551. that is, five months before the new Form was ſet out, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by no Form in force, even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of this Realm. So he, pag. 510. This argument at the firſt appearance ſeems preſſing, and <hi>Champny</hi> doth not a litle ſet by it,
<note place="margin">By what Form.</note> From hence (ſaith he) <hi>inevitably it is concluded, that thoſe two were never conſecrated indeed,</hi> and therefore not Parker, as is <hi>pretended;</hi> whereupon he concludes <hi>Maſonum protervum &amp; inverecundum, that</hi> Maſon <hi>was obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſhameleſs in avouching</hi> Parkers <hi>due conſecration,</hi> pag. 511. But I ſhall eaſily make appear the weakneſs of this argument as raiſed upon a meer miſtake, either through his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency of what he might have obſerved in the Statutes, or his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full concealment of what he did ſee. The caſe ſtands thus. It is true that the <hi>Ordinals</hi> are named with other ſuperſtitious books, and with them aboliſhed in the Parliament of 2. and 3. of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. and true alſo, that the form of Ordination, after agreed on was confirmed in the Parliament
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:114611:143"/>of the 5. and 6. of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. but here is the miſtake. That form was not then firſt publiſhed, or then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the firſt Autority, but was in force before, by vertue of a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionall Ordinance, of the former Parliament which aboliſhed the old <hi>Ordinals.</hi> For look into the 12. <hi>Chap.</hi> of that Parliament and ſee it there ordained, that 12 <hi>Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſix Prelats and ſix other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Gods Law, ſhould be choſen by the King to draw up ſuch a Form, and that to be ſet out under the Great-Seale before</hi> April <hi>next following; and that it ſhould be uſed and no other.</hi> So that from that time it was in force, and accordingly was uſed in the conſecration of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Biſhops, (<hi>Scory</hi> and <hi>Coverdal) Aug.</hi> 30. which followed that <hi>April,</hi> and went before the Parliament of the 5. and 6. of <hi>Edward.</hi> In which Parliament, that Form was again confirmed, by adjoyning it to the book <hi>of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or publick Prayer,</hi> under the like proviſions, exceptions, penalties, and with the ſame clauſes, as that book

                  <hi>Of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity of publick Prayer,</hi> was Provided for in the 2. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. This was the purpoſe of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as by the expreſs words of the Statute appears; not to give the firſt force to Autority of that Form which it received by the Act (as I ſaid) of the former Parliament, as ſoon as it was ſet forth under the Great-Seal) but to ſecure it by like proviſions and penalties, as the book of public prayer was, to which they annexed it. This is the iſſue of <hi>Champneys</hi> confidence, who, out of the ſtrength thereof, often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoots his Mark.</p>

<note place="margin">The Records publikly ſhewn to Romiſh Prieſts.</note> When he had thus far proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with great aſſurance diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited <hi>Parkers</hi> Conſecration, and the public Records, he meets with a true ſtory that daſheth all; and that is the ſatisfaction given to 4. <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts by Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But <hi>Champny</hi> muſt ſet a good face and encounter it boldly.

               <p>
                  <hi>Champny</hi> would not take notice (as I obſerved above) of that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which Doctor <hi>Reinolds</hi> had given <hi>Hart</hi> the Jeſuite, touching theſe Records, and related by <hi>Maſon</hi> upon his own knowledg; but this
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:114611:144"/>other was ſo home, that he could neither overlook it, nor deny it. Only he ſaith, <hi>they had a ſleight view of ſuch a book, but not permitted to peruſe it as it was requiſite, and when thoſe Prieſts by letter to the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, begged leave to have a farther ſight of it, they could not obtein it,</hi> pag, 527. If ſaying, or unſaying can blemiſh ſo public an Action, there will never want ſome among the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts to do it confidently. But is it likely, that ſo many Prelats, Perſons of great ſeverity and gravity, ſhould in ſo ſolemn an action, play boyes play with their Adverſaries, to give them a ſight of the Records, and then preſently withdraw them? to put the book into their hands, and then preſently ſnatch it from them? Or that ſuch Prelats ſhould meet to act a part in countenancing forged Records? To ſay nothing of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere gravity of all thoſe Biſhops, Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> of all men living was leaſt, fit to do it, who I dare ſay, would have caſt off his Biſhoprick, rather then held it by ſuch a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded warrant, and ſo will all thoſe

This is that which Doctor <hi>Champny</hi> endeavours to make good, by returning ſome anſwer to the crimes laid againſt them, and by making ſome proof that the Queen was no competent Judg in ſuch a buſineſſe.

Neither is the queſtion here what was obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to them, but what they deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The objecting of their refuſal of the Oath was enough for their deprivation by the Statute newly Enacted: yet their preſumptuous demeanour in the other particulars was no ſmall aggravation of their offence, and might be too of the Queens juſt diſpleaſure againſt them 2. <hi>Champny</hi> allegeth two examples, the One in relation to the <hi>Conference,</hi> the Other to the <hi>Crowning;</hi> the firſt is of Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> that refuſed to diſpute with the <hi>Arrians.</hi> But this is far wide from the buſineſs in hand; whether we look at the <hi>Subject Matter</hi> of the diſpute, which with Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was a chief funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point, the Deity of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, and newly declared in a General Councel: with us the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of the Conference were certain points; which as held by Proteſtants are ſo far from being againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of any General Councel, that they are moſt clearly according
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:114611:150"/>to the judgment of the Ancient Church. Or look we at the <hi>End</hi> or purpoſe of the diſpute, which with us was <hi>public ſatisfaction to all perſons doubting,</hi> and to bring about <hi>a good and charitable agreement;</hi> and this upon the command of the Prince, the deſire and expectation of the whole Kingdom; but no ſuch good purpoſe, intent, or expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the diſpute or alteration un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
               <p n="8">8. His other Example relates to their not <hi>Crowning</hi> of the Queen; <hi>Euphemius</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Patriarch of</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>refuſed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> Anaſtaſius <hi>for Emperour, but repell'd him as an Heretick, till he promiſed to admit the Councel of</hi> Chalcedon. Here again is another fundamental point, and the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an undoubted General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel: which notwithſtanding could not give <hi>Euphemius</hi> warrant to do any more then: expreſs his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the unworthineſs of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. But what is this to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of Crowning the Queen, whoſe
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:114611:150"/>right they had acknowledged, whoſe faith they could not queſtion, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to any approved Councel? For what are the Novel Articles of <hi>Romiſh</hi> faith to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Chriſtian Faith declared in the Ancient Councels? And yet muſt Princes, by the judgment (it ſeems) of <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> not have their Crowns, if they will not firſt admit that faith; or elſe loſe them, if after by due Reformation they caſt it off. Thus far of the offence of thoſe Biſhops, as to the buſineſs of <hi>Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Conference,</hi> of which offence the Queen might well be a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent judg, it being ſo apparant for the fact, and againſt ſo known a duty.</p>

<note place="margin">Their refuſal of the Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</note> Now to the other offence char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on them, the Refuſal of the Oath of Supremacy, the chief cauſe of their deprivation. Upon this Doctor <hi>Champny</hi> ſpends his 15. and 16. <hi>chap.</hi> and, that he may prove that Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unjuſt, ſtates the queſtion thus, <hi>Whether Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>with her Councel or Parliament could deprive thoſe.

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:114611:151"/>ſwear, that ſhe was the Supreme Head of the Church of</hi> England, pag. 536. and thereupon makes his Argument thus. <hi>That Judgment is unjuſt, which is given by an incompetent Judg.</hi>— Now to prove the <hi>Queen and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> were not competent Judges, he ſuppoſes it as clear, that this was a Cauſe <hi>ad fidem &amp; Religionem directe pertinentem, directly perteining to Faith and Religion</hi>— and then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes, that neither the Queen nor any Lay-perſons could be competent Judges of Biſhops in ſuch a Cauſe.— This he largely purſues, by places of Scripture which ſhew that Biſhops and Paſtors are ſet in the Church to teach all others (of what degree and rank ſoever) in matters of Faith and Religion, and therefore cannot be judged by them in ſuch matters. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that heareth you, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth me,</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Obey thoſe that have the rule over you and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi>—and the like.

<note place="margin">The Title of Supreme Head of the Church.</note> But to his whole Argument in his 15. Chapter, we may return this general anſwer. There are thus many failings in it. I. The queſtion wrong ſtated; for thoſe Biſhops were not put to <hi>ſwear the Q. was Supreme Head of the Church of England;</hi> there are no ſuch words in the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, but, that the <hi>Q. was Supreme Governor of the Realm of</hi> England <hi>and all other her Majeſties Dominions in ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical things and Cauſes</hi>—For upon notice of offence

But <hi>Champny</hi> wittingly reteins the former Title, as obnoxious to more reproach and Envy. II. His Argument touches not the whole cauſe, or the main part of it, which concerned the renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of forrein Juriſdiction. III. The cauſe rightly ſtated is not a <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter directly perteining to faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> as he takes for granted. IV. Albeit ſuch a Judgment of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters perteining to Faith and Religion, as thoſe Emperors denyed, doth not indeed belong unto them or any Lay-Perſons, yet may Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors have ſuch a judgment, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the due exerciſing their ſupreme power in and about matters and cauſes of Faith and Religion.</p>

                     </gap>.</note> That all this may the better appear, We muſt obſerve there are two things conſiderable in the Oath of Supremacy: What is attributed to the Sovereign Prince, and then
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:114611:152"/>what is denyed to the Pope or any forrein Potentate; and accordingly there is commonly a double miſtake which the Adverſaries and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this Oath, (this Docter <hi>Champ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> in particular) do run upon. The Firſt is the overlooking of the main thing aimed at in this Oath, which is not ſo much the affirming or attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting a Supremacy to the Prince, as the denying and renouncing of the Papal Supremacy and Juriſdiction, and the excluding it out of this Land. For it is ſecurity which the Prince ſeeks here, and that ſtands not ſo much in receiving acknowledgments of Titles, and bare aſſertions from Subjects, as in their renouncing of all adverſe power, and promiſing not to obey it: In ſpecial, that known uſurped power of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> mentioned and branded as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable in all the Statutes that concern the Supremacy of the Crown; and ſo indeed it deſerved to be, both for the intolerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and exactions it laid upon the Subjects of this Land, and for the dangerous poſitions and Doctrines
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:114611:153"/>it draws after it, to the unſufferable prejudice of the Prince, his Crown and dignity; as, <hi>The exemption of all Eccleſiaſtical Perſons,</hi> which in effect makes them none or but half Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>The depoſing of Kings, and dispoſing of their Kingdoms upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,</hi> which makes them no Kings, or but at the Popes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: and according to the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the Oath of <hi>Allegeance</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. in his firſt <hi>Breve,</hi> to contein many things <hi>flat contrary to the Catholic Faith, and to the ſalvation of Souls,</hi> and therefore by no means to be taken by any of his Catholicks. And have not Princes good cauſe to look to themſelves upon this point of Supremacy, to the excluding of ſuch forrein Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, ſo dangerous, ſo injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?</p>
               <p n="12">12. Now that Security from this uſurped power and juriſdiction is chiefly ſought and aimed at in this Oath, appears by the Oaths which all the Biſhops under King <hi>Henr.</hi> 8. and King <hi>Edw:</hi> 6. made, in which the firſt main thing is their renouncing
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:114611:153"/>of the Papal Juriſdiction, and their ſwearing never to admit it again within this Land: and by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes under.

<note place="margin">Papal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy no cauſe or point of Faith.</note> This therefore being the main point of the Oath, as that wherein the Prince is mainly concerned, it tels us, how their offence ariſes, and what they deſerve, that by denying this Oath refuſe to renounce ſuch forrein Juriſdiction: and how the Kings and Queens of this Realm, if they could well underſtand their

<note place="margin">Second miſtake, is of what we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Prince.</note> The ſecond miſtake is in that, which by this Oath of Supremacy is attributed to the Prince, as if, by this Supreme power <hi>in Spirituall and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall things,</hi> He were made Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judg of Faith, &amp; decider of all controverſies thereunto belonging, and might ordain what he thought fit in matters of Religion.

Edw. 6. cap. 2. Alſo Juriſdiction <hi>for Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Eccleſiaſtical State, and Perſons, and for Reformation and correction of the ſame, and of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of errors, Hereſies, Schiſmes,</hi> —1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. Now ſee what hath been declared for the explaining and bounding this Supremacy. The Queen upon knowledge of offence taken at the Title of <hi>Supreme Head of the Church,</hi> waved it,
<note place="margin">Explicati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of the former At<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tributions.</note> as was ſaid above, and declared in Her Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition annexed to her Injunctions,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:114611:156"/>that nothing elſe was challenged by that Supremacy, <hi>but to have a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and Rule, under God, over all Perſons born within her Realms of what Eſtate ſoever, Eccleſiastical or Temporal, ſo as no other forrein power ſhall or ought to have Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over them:</hi> and that nothing elſe was, is, or ſhall be intended by the Oath. So Article 37. of our Church, is thus declared, <hi>We give to our Princes that Prerogative which we ſee in Scripture alwayes given to all godly Princes by God himſelf, to rule all ſtates and degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be Eccleſiaſtical or Temporal, and to reſtrain with the Sword all ſtubborn and evil doers.</hi> So then we ſee by theſe Declarations, what is meant by this Supremacy: <hi>viz.</hi> a Soveraignty over all perſons &amp; eſtates (though Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical) to <hi>rule</hi> them, &amp;c. If it be ſaid the Supremacy is not only over all <hi>Perſons,</hi> but alſo in all <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Things</hi> Eccleſiaſtical, we bound this latter by the former, ſaying, that Kings have and neceſſarily muſt have a Supreme power in and about Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:114611:156"/>and things Eccleſiaſtical, ſo far as is neceſſary to the <hi>ruling</hi> all Perſons of what eſtate ſoever, moving and commanding them to act according to their ſeveral ſtations and offices for the ſervice of God and his Church, keeping them to their known duty, and, as occaſion may require, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing them for tranſgreſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>

<note place="margin">Princes have their judgment about Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Doctrine defined.</note> And in order to the due uſing of that ſupream and Sovereign <hi>Power,</hi> we muſt allow him (that he go not blindly to work) <hi>Judgment</hi> in receiving of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: not only a <hi>private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſcretion,</hi> which we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low every man, in order to his own believing, but alſo a <hi>publick Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> anſwerable to the publick care and office he bears; Yet is it not that <hi>immediat and ordinary Judgment</hi> of Matters of Religion, which belongs to Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church, in order to our believing, but that <hi>ſecundary Judgment</hi> (as I may call it) which is neceſſary in the Sovereign, for his eſtabliſhing by Lawes, that which is evidenced to him upon the Judgment and adviſe of the Paſtors of the Church. This Judgment in matters of Religion in order to public eſtabliſhment, the Sovereign ought to have upon a double reaſon: I. In reſpect of his duty to God, whoſe Lawes and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:114611:160"/>worſhip He is bound to eſtabliſh by his own Laws within his Dominions, and is accountable for it, if he do it amiſs, as the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Juda</hi> were. II. In reſpect of his own and his peoples ſecurity, to judg that nothing be concluded or broached prejudicial thereunto, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of Religion and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Autority, as many points of Popery are.

               <p>The <hi>judgment</hi> requiſite to make the demonſtration of truth out of Gods Word, and to give out the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, belongs to the Eccleſiaſtick Paſtors; but the <hi>judgment</hi> requiſite in receiving the Evidence is needful in all: eſpecially and upon a publick concernment in Princes, that they may diſcern that nothing is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded prejudicial to their juſt Rights, or hurtful to their Subjects.

<note place="margin">How Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours ſhewed their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy in matters of the Church and of Religion.</note> In the laſt place let us ſee what is anſwered to Maſter <hi>Maſons</hi> Inſtances of godly Emperours ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Lawes, and taking Order in matters of Religion, and of the Church. To theſe <hi>Champny</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in his 16. <hi>Chapter.</hi> Firſt, <hi>None of them ever excluded the Jurisdiction of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>out of their Realms, as this Oath doth.</hi> pag. 557. True, that none of them denyed him his Patriarchal Primacy known and bounded by the firſt general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, neither would it have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed him in this Realm, could he have conteined himſelf within the due bounds thereof; but ſuch a Papal Juriſdiction, as was uſurped by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for ſome Ages paſt, thoſe good Emperors never knew, never would have endured. If he can ſhew us they admitted ſuch Juriſdiction, or that the General Councels acknowledged it, we will alſo acknowledg the Popiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:114611:168"/>were unjuſtly deprived as to that point.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Thoſe Emperors by their Laws did but confirm, and in their doings about Church-affairs, did but follow the Canons and judgment of former Councels.</hi> This is the ſumme of his ſecond anſwer. And this is true of many of them: but derogats nothing from their Supremacy; for it only implyes <hi>Direction</hi> received, which we acknowledg Kings and Emperours ought in Eccleſiaſtical matters to receive from the Paſtors of the Church, in or out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel: It doth not infringe the <hi>Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> which they have both in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding</hi> the Paſtors of the Church to meet in Councel, in <hi>taking an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> of what is done, and how; and laſtly <hi>in confirming</hi> their decrees and Canons; as was before inſinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="30">30. Again, That anſwer is not true of all the Laws and Actions of pious and good Emperors in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout matters of Religion or the Church, as may appear by that which is cited by Mr. <hi>Maſon,</hi> by
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:114611:169"/>Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> in his book <hi>of true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> by Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> againſt <hi>Tortus,</hi> and by other Writers. To inſtance in one, which being urged by <hi>Maſon, Champny</hi> thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf concerned to labour in the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it. The ſecond Councel of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> had, by the prevalency of a ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring faction in it, paſſed judgment for depoſing the good Biſhop <hi>Flavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi> and advanced the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Error. Hereupon <hi>Leo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> with other Biſhops, humbly ſupplicated the Emperour <hi>Theodoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> that all things might ſtand in the ſame condition in which they were before any of thoſe judgments, till a greater number of Biſhops could be gathered out of the whole World, <hi>Ep.</hi> 43. and in another Epiſtle, he thus beſpeaks the Emperor, <hi>The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Councel of</hi> Epheſus, <hi>which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called a Councel (becauſe held to the ſubverſion of the Faith,) You moſt glorious Emperour,</hi> aliud ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo caſſabis, <hi>will make void or null by a contrary Decree, for the love you bear the Truth,</hi> &amp;c. In all this, Three things are evident, I. That a
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:114611:169"/>King or Emperour may and ought (as he tenders the <hi>Truth of God</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form or extirpate an Error or Hereſie prevailing, when it is made manifeſt to him by the information and advice of godly Biſhops, as here by <hi>Leo</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other his <hi>fellow-Biſhops,</hi> who as he ſaid joyned with him in the ſupplication, although there be no foregoing Synodical judgment againſt the ſame Error, as there had not yet been againſt the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Hereſie. II. That He may Null and make void the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Decree (<hi>i. e.</hi> forbid it to be received) of a Synod when manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, that it was carryed by faction to the ſubverſion of the Faith; as this of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was; upon which reaſon the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> as was ſaid, refuſed to receive the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of <hi>Trent:</hi> III. That the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour might and ought to call a greater number of Biſhops together for the confirmation of the Truth, and ſo the Councel of <hi>Calcedon</hi> was gathered by the Emperour <hi>Martia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſee we how <hi>Champny</hi> beſtirs
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:114611:170"/>himſelf to get through the paſſages of this ſtory. <hi>Leo</hi> ſaith, he, did <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternè hortari, fatherly exhort the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to defend the Truth, as every good Prince ſhould</hi>—pag. 568. This (though ſhort of an <hi>humble ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> made to the Emperour) is fair, and we deſire no more, then that it be granted, Princes may and ſhould do ſo much within their Realms, as the Emperour is here <hi>ſupplicated</hi> or <hi>exhorted</hi> to do. <hi>And accordingly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour did,</hi> praeſcriptum Leonis ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutus, <hi>following the praeſcript of Leo.</hi> pag. 565. Now he makes the good Biſhop ſpeak and take upon him like one of the later Popes. Well this agrees not with the <hi>humble ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> made to the Emperour; but what ſaith he to the thing ſupplicated for, that the Emperour <hi>would make void that Councel by a Decree to the contrary?</hi> I cannot find any thing in <hi>Champney</hi> that anſwers to it, but that <hi>Leo deſired a ſuspenſion of the Decree and Judgment of the former Councel</hi> —Which, (though ſhort of that which is deſired) is enough to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:114611:170"/>that Autority which we deſire to vindicate to Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours in matters of the Church, without wronging or invading the Office of the Paſtors of the Church: for both the Emperour and they had their parts in this Action. <hi>Champny</hi> in ſtead of giving us a good account of the former point, thinks to croſs us with another paſſage of the ſtory: <hi>Flavianus,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the depoſed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, appeals from the unjuſt ſentence, not to the Emperor but the Biſhop of Rome, and delivers his appellation to his Legats,</hi> which was an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of <hi>his being ſupreme Judg,</hi> pag. 561. But this cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in <hi>Champnys</hi> ſenſe of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preem Judg,</hi> for it ſounds nothing but the primacy of Order among the Patriarchs. <hi>Flavianus</hi> delivered his appellation to the Popes Legats, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were preſent, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was not, becauſe in order the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was the firſt, and becauſe he knew that <hi>Leo</hi> was truly favourable to his cauſe, and would commend it to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; which he did, and did it ſo,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:114611:171"/>as appealing himſelf to the next general Councel, which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſhould gahter; as we heard in his ſupplication to <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> though chief Patriarchs, the only or chief preſidence in all the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councels, but according as the Emperour ſaw fit, as appears by the acts of thoſe Councels.</p>
               <p>But to conclude. In replication to that common anſwer of <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> that Kings and Emperours in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding about Church affaires did but follow the determinations of foregoing Councels, <hi>Maſon</hi> had told them, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for this power and Supremacy had the determination of a Synod un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. by unanimous aſſent acknowledging it. To this <hi>Champ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> replies, <hi>What Authority had that Synod, where the Biſhops were compelled by fear to conſent to that, which they after voluntarily revoked under Queen</hi> Mary? <hi>Or what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority could a Snyod of the Biſhops of one Kingdome have againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the whole world</hi>— p. 549. 550.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:114611:171"/>But this of the <hi>conſent of the whole world</hi> is only a brag, and it is yet to be proved that the late uſurped Jurisdiction of the Pope was ever known to the Antient Church, or ever received ſince, through all the Chriſtian world. As for compulſion and defect of freedom, which he notes for the nulling of the Autorty of a Synod, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg the Doctrine good, and ſay he gives us a juſt way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> and all or moſt of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels that have been held under that uſurped Papal Supremacy ſince <hi>Hildebrand</hi> or <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh his time. But we deny the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it to the Synods under <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. See above, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Num.</hi> 3. concerning this allegation of fear and compulſion, where there was cauſe to think, the evidence of Truth compelled them, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what the moſt learned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them did voluntarily write againſt the Papal Uſurpation. And I cannot but here acknowledg the Providence of God, ſo diſpoſing
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:114611:172"/>of this buſineſs, that the Papal ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy or uſurped Juriſdiction ſhould be voted out of this Land, firſt by the Popiſh party, as I may call them, and that they which had twice been ſworn againſt the admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it again into this Land, as many of the deprived Biſhops had been under King <hi>Henry</hi> and King <hi>Edward,</hi> and then voluntarily broken their double Oath under Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhould be depoſed under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for that very cauſe of aſſerting the Papal Supremacy.</p>

<note place="margin">VVhether Chriſt offered himſelf up in the Iaſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> Firſt, It is true that ſome Fathers ſeem to ſay, Chriſt offered himſelf up in his Laſt Supper; but it is evident they meant it not really and properly (for how could it be ſo, where there was no real effuſion of his blood, no real occiſion or death) but myſtically, or as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſometimes expreſſeth it, <hi>ſignificante myſterio,</hi> in a Myſtery or Sacrament, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying or repreſenting his Sa ifice or Offering on the Croſs preſently to follow: that <hi>Sacramentum Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minici Saerificii,</hi> Sacrament of the Lords Sacrifice, as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls it, Ep. 63. <hi>ad Cacil.</hi> The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament then, at his Laſt Supper, ſhewing the Lords death, that ſhould be, or the Sacrifice that ſhould be offered on the Croſs: and the Sacrament now ſhewing the Lords death that was, and the Sacrifice that was Offered.

                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:114611:179"/>that the Chriſtians ſhould do ſo.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:114611:179"/>rather then of the external Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, and therefore ſeeming to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a real Converſion of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation of the Symbols into the Body and blood of Chriſt, and a real Sacrifice, or Offering up of that Body and blood again in the Euchariſt, yet do they ſometimes punctually, and poſitively expreſs their meaning by the <hi>Memorial, Repreſentation,</hi> and <hi>ſhewing</hi> in the Sacrament what was done upon the Croſs; and this they learnt from Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. to <hi>do this</hi> is to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,</hi> and to <hi>ſhew</hi> the Lords death.

No, but by deſcription, ſetting forth, or repreſentation of his Death and Paſſion often made among them in the Word and Sacraments. Now for this explication of this manner of ſpeech uſed by the Fathers, I ſhall inſtance only in three of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:114611:180"/>them. Firſt, in <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> who of all the Fathers ſpeaks moſt high and Hyperbolically in this matter of the Euchariſt; and the place ſhall be that which <hi>Champ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> here cites, as advantagious to his cauſe; <hi>Homil.</hi> 17. in <hi>Hebr.</hi> he puts theſe queſtions: <hi>Do we not offer daily? Offerimus quidem,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſed mortem ejus in memoriam revocamus,</hi> we offer, but it is by making a remembrance of his death. Again, becauſe we offer often, <hi>quomodo una eſt &amp; non multae?</hi> how is his death or offering up but one and not many? <hi>Hoc eſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>figura illius,</hi> what we do is the <hi>figure</hi> of that. And becauſe, he is offered in many places, <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine ſunt Chriſti?</hi> are there many Chriſts? No, <hi>hoc fit in recordati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem ejus quod tunc factum:</hi> What we do, is done in remembrance of what was then done by him. Laſtly, We offer not <hi>aliam Hoſtiam,</hi> another Sacrifice, but <hi>Eandem ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per facimus, vel potiùs hoſtiae, ſeu ſacrificii recordationem facimus,</hi> we offer alwaies the ſame that Chriſt
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:114611:180"/>did, <hi>or rather</hi> (mark this correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelf) we make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his oblation or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. He would be accounted a Lutheran or Heretick in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that ſhould ſo anſwer to theſe queſtions. Next, S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Ep. 23. ſolves the like queſtion. Chriſt (ſaith he) was once <hi>immolatus in ſemetipſo,</hi> offered up or ſacrificed in himſelf, but is he not alſo daily in the Sacrament? <hi>Non Mentitur qui interrogatus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondet, immolari:</hi> he ſhould not lye, that being asked that queſtion, ſhould anſwer, <hi>He is offered up:</hi> and what is his reaſon? <hi>quia Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudinem,</hi> becauſe of that neer ſimilitude, which Sacraments have of thoſe things, of which they are Sacraments. But <hi>Champny</hi> and the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do lye, when they ſay, <hi>Immolatur,</hi> He is offered up in their ſenſe (<hi>i. e.</hi> really, properly) and when they ſay, the Prieſt hath power ſo to offer him up. But we do not lye, if we ſay (as the Fathers did) Chriſt is offered in the Euchariſt, or that the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:114611:181"/>is his Death and Paſſion, or that the Bread and Wine is his Body and Blood, or that he is truly preſent in the Sacrament. Yea in ſuch attributions of the thing ſignified to the Sacrament,
<note place="margin">Queſtions made by Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be anſwered affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, rather then nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</note> we ought to anſwer affirmatively; and that becauſe of the ſimilitude and neer union between the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the thing ſignified; but eſpecially becauſe of the effect to which God hath ordained the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that it ſhould be ſo really to us, in the true application of the Sacrifices of the Croſs to us, in our real Communion and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of his body and blood, in our real conjunction unto Chriſt. Many other places there are of the ſame Father to the like purpoſe, as <hi>lib.</hi> 20. <hi>contra Fauſtum,</hi> cap. 21. ſpeaking of the reſpect which the Sacrifice before, and the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt after, had to the Sacrifice of the Croſs, in thoſe ſaith he, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittebatur,</hi> it was promiſed: in his Paſſion the fleſh and blood of Chriſts Sacrifice <hi>per ipſam verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem reddebatur;</hi> was truly and really

Evang.</hi> cap. 10. accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſets down and clears this whole buſineſs of the Euchariſt; There he ſhews why Chriſtians do not offer Beaſts in Sacrifice as the Patriarchs did before the Law: <hi>becauſe all ſuch are taken away in Chriſts Sacrifice, which they did prefigure;</hi> alſo, <hi>becauſe Chriſtians have Spirituall Sacrifices now to offer unto God, but foretold in the Pſalms, and the Prophets;</hi> and thereupon he tels us the relation of the Euchariſt to the Sacrifice on the Croſs; <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith he,

<note place="margin">Vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or Reply of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts.</note> All that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have to reply unto the Evidence of theſe and other Fathers, ſpeaking pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of that reſpect and relation the Euchariſt hath to the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice on the Croſs, comes to this; that the placing of a <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> or <hi>repreſentation</hi> of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Croſs in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, doth not hinder it to be a true and proper Sacrifice alſo: no more, ſaith <hi>Champny,</hi> pag. 699. then the reſpect, which the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Law had to Chriſts Sacrifice hindered them to be true and real Sacrifices. But all this is very impertinent; for if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had barely ſaid, there was a remembrance in the Euchariſt of Chriſts Sacrifice, it had not excluded a real Sacrifice; but when in explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelves (why they call the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:114611:183"/>Euchariſt a Sacrifice of the body and blood of Chriſt, and why they ſay Chriſt is there offered up,) they give it for the reaſon of their ſo ſpeaking, becauſe that Sacrifice once offered by our Saviour is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, ſhewn, and repreſented, it is moſt plain they did not think that which is done in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt to be a real Sacrificing of Chriſt. Their Inſtance alſo of the Legal Sacrifices is as impertinent, for they were real Sacrifices in regard of the Beaſts really ſlain, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: Now if the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will have the Bread and Wine (which repreſent the Body and Blood which was really offered) to be the real Sacrifice in the Euchariſt, then indeed the remembrance or repreſentation of Chriſts Sacrifice there doth not hinder but there may be alſo an external oblation (and ſo many Fathers accounted the Bread and Wine to be, as they were brought and offered to that Holy uſe and ſervice) But the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will not ſay the Bread and Wine is the Sacrifice, they contend for,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:114611:183"/>but that it is the very Body and Blood which is offered up; Which Body and Blood being the ſame, that was offered up upon the Croſs, their Real Sacrifice cannot have help by their inſtance of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Sacrifices of the Bodies and blood of Beaſts, but ſtands exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Fathers, ſaying, Chriſt is offered up in the Euchariſt by a <hi>Myſticall ſignification,</hi> by a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,</hi> by <hi>repreſentation,</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſaid. It is very remarkable what <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> ſaith to this purpoſe. The Queſtion he puts is the ſame we have in hand, and his Reſolution the ſame we give to it; <hi>Si quod gerit Sacerdos,</hi> &amp;c. Whether that, which the Prieſt doth be properly called a Sacrifice or offering up? and whether Chriſt is daily offered up, or was but once? To the firſt he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, It is called a Sacrifice, <hi>quia memoria eſt &amp; repreſentatio veri Sacrificii in arâ crucis</hi>—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the remembrance and repreſentation of that true Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice on the Croſs; To the ſecond,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:114611:184"/>Chriſt once died on the Croſs, <hi>ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que immolatus eſt in Semetipſo,</hi> and there was offered up in himſelf, or offered up himſelf indeed, but he is daily offered up in the Sacrament, <hi>quia in Sacramento fit recordatio il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins quod factum eſt Semel,</hi> becauſe in the Sacrament, there is made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of that, which was done once upon the Croſs. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> anſwer here is a miſerable ſhift; That the Maſter of the Sentences by this doth not deny a real Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in the Sacrament,
<note place="margin">Another vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</note> but a real <hi>Occiſion</hi> or killing of Chriſt. For as this is plainly impertinent to <hi>Lombards</hi> reſolution of the queſtion, ſo is it to that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and all of them do and muſt grant, that in a real Sacrifice there muſt be a real <hi>deſtruction</hi> or conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thing Sacrificed: and they are as hard put to it, to ſhew this <hi>destruction</hi> or conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, as to ſhew his <hi>Occiſion;</hi> for at laſt it comes to this with them, that the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread and Wine under which they will have
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:114611:184"/>his body and bloud to be, are deſtroyed, and not his body indeed. A fair reckoning. This place of <hi>Lambard</hi> was cited by <hi>Maſon,</hi> and <hi>Champny</hi> perceiving, as it ſeems, the weakneſs of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> anſwer, doth wiſely take no notice of it, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther omitting to ſpeak any thing to it. But to my apprehenſion it is very conſiderable, 1. Becauſe it was the purpoſe and work of the Maſter of the Sentences to gather a body of Theologie, or Reſolutions to all Theological Doubts, out of the Sentences of the Fathers: and to this <hi>Quare</hi> of a <hi>Real Sacrifice,</hi> he could draw out of them no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution then what we have heard. 2. Becauſe it is a clear evidence, how this preſent Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> touching a real Sacrifice, was not formed or believed ſo long after the age of thoſe Fathers, they ſo much boaſt of. The ſumm of all is this. The Fathers uſually expreſſed the Celebration or work of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt by the Words of Sacrifice, or offering up the Body of Chriſt for themſelves and others, becauſe
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:114611:185"/>there was a <hi>Repreſenting</hi> of the real Sacrifice of the Croſs, and a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting</hi> (as we may ſay) of it again to God for the impetration or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the benefits thereof for themſelves, and for all thoſe, they remembred in the Celebration of the Euchariſt.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Fourthly,
<note place="margin">Of prayer and Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for the Dead.</note> It is true, that the Ancient Fathers ſpeak of offering this Sacrifice for the dead, but far from the Popiſh ſenſe, according to which, <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts in their Ordination are ſaid to receive <hi>Power to offer Sacrifice for the Quick and Dead:</hi> For that offering for the Dead, which the Ancients ſpeak of, in the Celebration of the Euchariſt, had the ſame extent, purpoſe and meaning, that their prayers there for the dead had; and theſe anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently were made for thoſe, whom they judged to be in bliſs; <hi>Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſors, Holy Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. and the purpoſes of the Church, in remembring thoſe in her publick prayers, were many: as we find in the Ancient Writers, eſpecially <hi>Epiphanius, Haer.</hi> 75. I may reduce
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:114611:185"/>them to theſe heads. Firſt, They were <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and preheminence of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all men, that all they ſtood in need of mercy, and that he only was not to be prayed for, but to be prayed to; (note all Invocation of Saints ſtood excluded then by theſe prayers for the Dead) of the happy eſtate of thoſe they prayed for, that they lived with God; Of their own hope, that they truſted to attain to the ſame ſtate of bliſs. Secondly, they were <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> for their ſleeping in the Lord. Thirdly, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions</hi> for that which was yet behind, for their conſummation: that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>the Redemption of the body, Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>the Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> to be given <hi>in the laſt day,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.8. <hi>the Mercy,</hi> which he prayes <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> may finde in that day, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18. The Arcient Prayer, which is yet reteined in the Canon of the Maſs, ſounds to this purpoſe; <hi>Remember O Lord, the Soules of thy Servants, which reſt in the ſleep of Peace,</hi>—This prayer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſeems to be framed with reſpect
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:114611:186"/>to that opinion, which anciently was very common in the Church, that the Souls of juſt men were not admitted into the ſight and preſence of God till the Reſurrection, but kept in Receptacles of Reſt, Peace and Light, of bleſſed comfort and refreſhment: yet it tells us, that which they prayed for them, was in regard of all the mercy and glory that was behind; And it is plain by the Writers of thoſe times, that this remembring of the Dead, thus in the Celebration of the Euchariſt (which was the repreſentation of Chriſts Sacrifice) was that which the Ancients cald <hi>Offering for them,</hi> or as in Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time, <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the Sacrifice of the Altar,</hi> or the <hi>Sacrifice of our Saviour</hi> for them, <hi>i.e.</hi> an <hi>acknowledging</hi> of, and <hi>thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi> for their ſleeping (<hi>pro dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi> as Saint <hi>Cypr.</hi> and others) in the Lord, and their ſaving by the merits of his death: and an <hi>Impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (by his Sacrifice then repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) of all that mercy, redemption and glory which was yet behind. Thus Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:114611:186"/>ſpeaks of Offering for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Monica,</hi> (whom he doubted not to be in bliſs) <hi>i. e.</hi> remembring her upon the like reſpects.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have applyed all prayers and Offering for the Dead to the Souls in Purgatory:

               <p n="10">10. Indeed in the fourth Century, they began to inquire, what bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the prayers and oblations of the Church might redound to them, which were not in <hi>requie,</hi> in reſt and ſleepe of peace, but in <hi>aerumnâ,</hi> in trouble and grief after this life. The ſecond Quaere <hi>ad Dulcitium,</hi> is to that purpoſe; where Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Paulinus</hi> had alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted him about it. Now to this <hi>Quaere,</hi> they ſpoke their private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, ſuch as their compaſſion to the dead ſuggeſted: Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> delivers his in that place, <hi>ad Dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium;</hi> in his <hi>Enchirid</hi> c. 109. and in his book <hi>de curâ pro Mortuis</hi>—Which book was alſo occaſioned by a like <hi>quaere</hi> put to him by <hi>Paulinus</hi> out of like curioſity:
<note place="margin">Private conceits about a Purging fire.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether it was any help to the dead, to have their bodies buried neer the Memories or Tombs of Martyrs?</hi> Then alſo was enquiry made after ſome kinde of purging fire to help ſuch as held the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, dying in the profeſſion of
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:114611:187"/>Chriſtian Faith, but whoſe lives were not anſwerable: as we may ſee by Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Lib. de fide &amp; oper,</hi> (where cap. 1. and 15. he confutes them, who conceived, by miſtake of the Apoſtles words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. that thoſe which dyed, profeſſed of the Chriſtian ſaith, might be purged from all their evill works by ſome fire, and ſo come to ſalvation, <hi>merito fundamenti,</hi> by reaſon of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion held) alſo in his <hi>Enchirid:</hi> cap. 109. and in 1. <hi>queſt. ad Dulciti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and in his 20. and 21. books, <hi>de Civ. Dei.</hi> Now though they differed in their conceits about this fire, whether it was immediatly after death, or at laſt day commonly cald <hi>Ignis conflagrationis;</hi> and about the Perſons to be purged and helped by it; yet all of them ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be a fire of <hi>Paſſage</hi> only for ſouls to go through to their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed receptacles; not a fire of <hi>Durance,</hi> for ſouls to lie in, as in a receptacle till the day of judgment, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> believe it. All that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> concludes upon it, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but uncertainty: <hi>Tale aliquid,</hi>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:114611:188"/>ſome ſuch thing may be after this life; and <hi>quaeri poteſt</hi>—it may be put to the queſtion, <hi>&amp; non eſt incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibile,</hi> it is not incredible, and <hi>forſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan verum eſt,</hi> perchance it may be true, ſo he of it, in the forementioned places. We ſee by this how from the curioſity of ſome of the Ancients enquiring after relief and help for thoſe Dead, whoſe ſtate was of more uncertain condition, <hi>Romiſh</hi> ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition hath taken her riſe: and how from the private opinions, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain conceits of ſome of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, length of Time and ſtrength of <hi>Romiſh</hi> preſumption hath framed Articles of Faith: this of Purgatory for one; in reſpect to which and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Souls tormented therein, their Prieſts receive power to offer Sacrifice, even the body and blood of our Saviour.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Now to conclude. By all that hath been ſaid, it appears how groundleſs, unwarrantable, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous this power is, which the Romiſh Prieſts pretend to; and how that power which our Prieſts or Presbyters receive in ordination, and
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:114611:188"/>uſe in celebrating the Euchariſt, is warranted by the expreſs Word, and doth the whole work of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſufficiently, according to all purpoſes that our Saviour intended it for, when he ſaid, <hi>do this:</hi> and according to the true and proper meaning of the Fathers, ſpeaking uſually of a Sacrifice in it. And this is ſo much more conſiderable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> place the higheſt and chiefeſt act of Worſhip Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall in this Sacrifice of the Maſs, and account the chief power and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Evangelicall Prieſthood or miniſtration, (<hi>totam vel maximam perfectionem ſacri Ordinis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Champny,</hi> pag. 184.) to be in this reall Sacrificing, or offering up the body and blood of Chriſt. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is moſt ſtrange that in all the Evangelicall Writings, there ſhould be no Precept for ſuch a Worſhip, no inſtitution of ſuch a Sacrifice, no commiſſion for uſing ſuch a power: and that ſeeing the Apoſtle had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten juſt occaſion to ſpeak of ſuch a Sacrifice and Prieſthood in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> nay, had all the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:114611:189"/>reaſon that could be to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them with it, had there been any ſuch; whereas we ſhew expreſs commands for that way of Worſhip we retein, (which with the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> is nothing in compariſon of their Maſs.) We ſhew direct com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for that power we uſe, of Preaching, Binding, Looſing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating and celebrating the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which they account but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and ſubſervient to the power of making the body of Chriſt and offering it up. As for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by our Saviours command <hi>Do this,</hi> we found them thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to affirm that Chriſt offered himſelf up to his Father for the ſins of the world in the Sacrament, flat contrary to the tenour of the Goſpel which yeilds that only to the Croſs: and expreſly contrary to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> who affirmes, <hi>he offered himſelf but once for ſin, Heb.</hi> cap. 7. and cap. 9. ſee above <hi>Num.</hi> 3. And when they have perſwaded themſelves of this untruth, that Chriſt offered himſelf up in the Euchariſt, how can they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure themſelves that <hi>do this</hi> war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:114611:189"/>them to do all they ſuppoſe he did, <hi>i.e.</hi> to offer him up, as he did himſelf? It is enough for us men to <hi>do this,</hi> as a Sacramentall action, <hi>bleſſing, diſtributing, eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and by adding to it <hi>in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,</hi> he plainly ſhews he meant no real <hi>Sacrifical</hi> action, by offering him up again, but the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> only, by repreſenting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring his once offering up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to death, and ſo the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Do this</hi> imports, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. How great preſumption is this for Mortal man to take upon him thus to offer up the Son of God? <hi>Bell lib.</hi> 3.

<pb n="354" facs="tcp:114611:190"/>his eternal Prieſthood, by interceding for us, and in that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting ſtill what he hath done and ſuffered for us: And we know, we have warrant and his appointment, to do the like Sacramentally here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>i.e.</hi> in the celebration of the Euchariſt to remember his Death, and Paſſion, and to repreſent his own Oblation upon the Croſs, and by it to beg and impetrate, what we or the Church ſtand in need of: We know alſo, that as He gives His Miniſters Commiſſion and Autority to do this, ſo he aſſiſts them here below by his power and grace; But that Chriſt ſhould daily here below offer himſelf up <hi>perſonally</hi> (for this <hi>Bellarmine</hi> muſt affirm in his qualifying of the <hi>Romiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pretend to take thus much upon them) into a promiſe, <hi>I will do this in remembrance</hi> of my ſelf, by your hands: A meaning of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours words, which the Apoſtle knew not, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he told the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> what it was to <hi>do this; ſo oft as ye eat—and drink this</hi>— 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. Yea, the Prieſt ſaith directly in order of their Maſs: <hi>Suſcipe Pater—hanc Hoſtiam— quam ego indignus ſervus tuus offero tibi</hi>—Receive, O Father, this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice—which I thine unworthy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant do offer up unto thee—They that compoſed this prayer knew not that Chriſt (as the Cardinal contrives it) offered up himſelf there by the hands of the Prieſt, or rather knew not that Chriſt was there really of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; but by the (<hi>Hanc Hoſtiam,</hi> this Sacrifice) meant as the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did, as ſhewn above. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more it is conſiderable, that to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this preſumptuouſly aſſumed po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have nothing but words and Figurative ſpeeches, uſed by the Fathers in this myſtery, which as was noted above, <hi>N.</hi> 7. cannot bear the real and proper Sacrificing aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:114611:191"/>by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Laſtly, it is conſiderable, when they are preſſed to the point to ſhew how this offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Euchariſt and on the Croſs can conſiſt, &amp; how his daily Offering up in their Maſs (which they make propitiatory) can ſtand without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation to his propitiatory Sacrifice on the Croſs, they are fain to make the one <hi>abſolute,</hi> the other but <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and depending wholly on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to acknowledg this their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and propitiatory Sacrifice to be but a means of applying the benefit, and that Sacrifice on the Croſs. And this comes home to that we ſay of the Sacrament, for God hath appointed the Sacraments to that purpoſe, of the applying the benefit of Chriſts paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Sacrifice, and to that purpoſe we uſe them as is noted above, <hi>N.</hi> 4.5.</p>
               <p>All this conſidered, We ſee how needleſs, unwarrantable &amp; preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous a thing this their Sacrifice of the Maſs, and that ſuch alſo is the power of Sacrificing given to their Prieſts, &amp; how vainly they reproach us for not aſſuming, &amp; as vainly que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the lawful calling of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</p>
